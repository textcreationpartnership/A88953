            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two main obſtacles which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre men from the apprehenſion of Gods word: the one, a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; the other, a ſtrange interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt is proper to Papiſts; the other is common to Proteſtants and Papiſts: and is indeed the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſeeing an unknowne tongue doth onely hide the truth from the unlearned, and ſo may ſomewhat eaſily be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but a falſe interpretation doth equally deprive both the wiſe and the ſimple of it: and ſo cauſeth the blind to leade the blinde. For whatſoever text of Scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded any otherwiſe then God meant by it, it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its interpretation, the word of man, and not of God, and conſequently in adhering to ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we believe not what God ſaith, but what man doth make him ſay. Now of Scriptures that are miſunderſtood, ſome are ſo difficult, that it is not poſsible to give a peremptory interpretation of them, of which ſort are ſome paſſages in
<pb facs="tcp:113937:4"/>
               <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and here and there in other parts of the Scripture) and in theſe we ſhould either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ignorance, or deliver our thoughts as evidences on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our deſire to attaine to the perfect knowledge of Gods word. Others againe are ſo plaine, that every common and ordinary underſtanding, if left to it ſelfe, cannot chooſe but take them in their true ſenſe; and not in that which is thruſt upon them by a falſe gloſſe. And of theſe ſome have been a long time controverted; and others have as long paſt unſuſpected, amongſt which are the many Prophecies which God hath reveal'd touching the future reſtauration of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the perſonall reigne of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt on earth. And ſurely whatſoever was the ground of the miſinterpretation of theſe Prophecies at the firſt, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an hatred of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> whom alone in their proper ſenſe they doe concerne, or ſome ſiniſter and ſelfe-reſpects) whatſoever, I ſay, was the ground of it at the firſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it hath been occaſioned by the inconſiderancie of the ungrounded application of the words <hi>[Jew and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite]</hi> indifferently to the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and of the words <hi>[Iſrael, Sion, and Jeruſalem]</hi> to the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when as there is not one text in all the Scripture, wherein a <hi>Gentile</hi> is cal'd a <hi>Jew,</hi> or an <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> or wherein the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is cal'd, <hi>Iſrael, Sion,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thoſe texts, <hi>Rom. 2. ver. 28.</hi> and <hi>29.</hi> and <hi>chap. 9. ver. 6.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi> are both by <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> underſtood of the <hi>Jewes</hi> only. And theſe words <hi>Gal. 6. ver. 16. [upon the Iſrael of God]</hi> are both by the ordinary and interlineary gloſſes underſtood likewiſe of the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely: ſo that it is, as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, <hi>And as many as walke according to this rule, peace be on thoſe Gentiles and mercy, and peace and mercy on thoſe Jewes.</hi> And ſurely if
<pb facs="tcp:113937:4"/>that text be not thus diſtinctly underſtood of the faithfull <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> there will either be a tautologie in the words: or elſe the laſt words muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Iſrael in blindneſſe,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle doth here alſo wiſh mercy, according to that which he ſaith of them, <hi>Rom. 10. ver. 1. That his hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael was, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And that the Tribes of the children of <hi>Iſrael, Rev. 7. ver. 4.</hi> are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be underſtood, <hi>Ribera</hi> and others acknowledge, and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> though he enclines to an allegorical interpretation of them in his commentaries on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet in his explication of the <hi>18.</hi> doubt of the <hi>11. chap.</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> he thus reſolutely determines againſt it. <hi>Quod Oraculum ad literam de converſione Judaeorum planè intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum videtur, quoniam Iſraelitae ſignati in fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ibi diſertè diſcernuntú<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:113937:6"/>the words <hi>[Iſrael, Iudah, Sion, Jeruſalem, &amp;c.]</hi> ſhould have been ſo often us'd in the Prophets, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intimation of a figurative ſenſe, yea with ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent circumſtances and contents ſhewing the contrary, if they had been myſtically intended: this alſo I ſay, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likely, ſeeing in the <hi>Revelation</hi> the myſticall ſenſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> but once ſpoken of; and of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but ſeldome mentioned, is plainely intimated unto us in the <hi>11.</hi> and <hi>17. chap.</hi> And for my owne part I am perſwaded, that the myſticall interpretation of the plaine Prophecies which concerne the <hi>Iewes</hi> future reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their owne Land, and our Saviours and the Saints viſible reigne over them and all other Nations hath been the occaſion of the various and unſatisfactory inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of moſt part of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and of ſome part of <hi>Daniels</hi> viſions: and that Divines will neither concurre in Judgement, nor come neare the truth in much of theſe obſcure Prophecies, till they agree upon the proper expoſition of the foreſaid plaine Prophecies; as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> that renowned Author calls them, in the <hi>293.</hi> and <hi>294.</hi> pages of his Comment, on the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> where he commends this to the conſideration of them that are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and able to judge of the myſteries of Divinity, to wit, <hi>Whether it be not the beſt and eaſieſt way of dealing with the Iewes; not to wreſt the moſt cleare Prophecies touching the affaires of Chriſts ſecond and glorious comming, to his firſt: but to perſwade them, that they are to expect no other Meſſias, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all thoſe things, then that Ieſus of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>whom their fore-fathers crucifyed — For while we thus wreſt thoſe moſt cleare Prophecies,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Iewes deride us, and are the more hardned in their unbeliefe.</hi> And doubtleſſe this, and the Idolatry
<pb facs="tcp:113937:6"/>of Papiſts are the principal motives, which keep us at ſuch a diſtance in affection, that the ordinary meanes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the preaching of the Goſpel, is neither exerciſed by us amongſt them, nor ſought unto by them amongſt us. But yet theſe ſtumbling blocks ſhall neither hinder, nor delay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meanes of their ſalvation, at their generall converſion.

However in the firſt place, the Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that we have as much reaſon to beleeve, that the Prophecies which ſpeak plainly of the Jewes, cannot be underſtood of any others; as we have to beleeve, that the Prophecies which ſpeake plainly of Chriſt cannot be underſtood of another: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that you doe very erroneouſly interpret theſe Prophecies, when you underſtand by them, the converſion of the Gentiles. And ſecondly, he may obſerve, that having cited 2 <hi>Sam. v.</hi> 12. <hi>When thy dayes be fulfilled, and thou ſhalt ſleep with thy Fathers, I will ſet up thy ſeed after thee, which ſhall proceed out of thy bowles, and I will
<pb facs="tcp:113937:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>eſtabliſh his kingdome.</hi> You ſay [This was true in the perſon of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and of Chriſt too properly.] Which is as much as we ſay, to wit, that God ſhall eſtabliſh unto Chriſt a civill and proper King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he did unto <hi>Solomon.</hi> And indeed it is beyond the force of theſe words in the 16. <hi>verſe. Thy houſe and thy Kingdome ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever before thee, thy throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> To prove, that Chriſts reigne and <hi>Solomons,</hi> that the type and thing ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified are not both to be underſtood properly and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: ſeeing the word <hi>[for ever]</hi> is not here to be taken in an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe, for an infinite time, but in a limited ſenſe, for a long time, (as we ſhew in our reply by many inſtances out of ſcripture) and ſo doth intimate unto us onely, that Chriſts Kingdome, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that not onely <hi>Solomons</hi> reigne, but his building of an houſe to the Lord too, is to be properly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt, the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, chapter</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. doth plainely reveale. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the man whoſe name is the Branch, and he ſhall grow up out of his place, and he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, even he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and he ſhall beare the glory, and ſhall ſit and rule upon his Throne, and the counſell of peace ſhall be between them both:</hi> In which words, <hi>[the Temple of the Lord]</hi> doth ſignifie the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes following doe ſhew; and there is no other ſignification of this phraſe in all the old Teſtament, as we have obſerved in our reply to your anſwer, where you expound our Saviours <hi>building of the Temple of the Lord,</hi> of the raiſing of his body from the grave: and yet here you make it to foreſhew the immoveable perſeverance of thoſe that were after his incarnation, to be called to the profeſſion of his name by a lively faith. So unſtedfaſt are you, and unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in what ſenſe to take his building of an houſe unto the Lord. And therefore although ſuch typicall propheſies as are compound oracles, were to have a double accompliſhment, yet it is queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether they were to have a different meaning.

Now when theſe prophecies are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led once in reſpect of the type, and againe in a more tranſcendent manner by Chriſt; if we deny what God hath done, we are falſe and ungrate: and if we expect them to be fulfilled yet againe in the type, it were a worſe returning then that of the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 4.9.

Neither is it true that the Kingdome of Chriſt of which we are now onely made meet to be partakers, is yet in being; or that it ſhall be, till Chriſts appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the Saints in light; (as we ſhew in our <hi>Reply</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt make better proofe of theſe Premiſes, to wit, that ſuch prophecies as are properly fulfill'd in the type, may be figuratively fulfill'd in the antitype: and that the Prophecies which we have quoted for the <hi>Jewes</hi> future deliverance, doe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew their deliverance from <hi>Babylon.</hi> And that thoſe which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew that deliverance, were typicall Prophecies. You muſt make better proofe, I ſay, of all this, before you can conclude, [That we deny what God hath done; or that we expect that is to come which is already paſt.] Yea it is very abſurd to thinke, that the Prophecies which concerne the <hi>Jewes</hi> deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> were typicall prophecies; Firſt, becauſe they are plaine Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which you confeſſe cannot be underſtood of any other, but of them of whom they ſpeak. And ſecondly, becauſe the type would not be of equal latitude with the thing typified, the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> with the redemption of themſelves, and all other Nations. And beſides it is manifeſt, that the Prophecies which we have alledg'd out of <hi>Zechary</hi> touching the Jewes future deliverance, (and which agree ſo well with the reſt in other Prophets) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd after the accompliſhment of the <hi>Jewes</hi> returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore cannot poſſibly be underſtood of that, but of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance not yet accompliſhed, and conſequently too cannot be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall prophecies, becauſe they have not been fulfill'd in the type.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly, the elect</hi> Jewes <hi>did not reſt upon the Moſaicall Types, but all the Prophets gave witneſſe unto Chriſt,</hi> that through his Name, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeves in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes, Act. 10.43. <hi>they</hi> beleeved that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt they ſhould be ſaved even as we, Act. 15.11. <hi>in this faith they died,</hi> Heb. 11.13. <hi>I ſay this Faith, becauſe as Faith is one in reſpect of the object,</hi> Eph. 4.5. <hi>So the Apoſtle declares our Faith by the example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Neither did they reſt on the promiſes as on earthly,</hi> but they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a better Countrey, that is, an heavenly, Heb. 11.16. <hi>and when they were tortured, they would not accept deliverance from their torments, that they might obtaine a better reſurrection,</hi> v. 35. <hi>was that an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope? no; they believed the redemption of their ſoules by the Meſsias,</hi> Pſal. 34.22. that he was to be wounded for their tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for their iniquities, and the chaſtiſement of their peace was to be upon Him, <hi>and that they were to be</hi> healed by his ſtripes. Eſa. 53.5. <hi>and</hi> Simeon <hi>waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael, when he ſew him, bleſſed God, and ſaid,</hi> Lord, now let thy ſervant depart in peace,—for my eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation. Luk. 2.29. <hi>He craves not longer life to reign with Chriſt on Earth, but was content to depart having ſeen the ſalvation of God, the light of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and glory of Iſrael.</hi>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label> The elect <hi>Jewes,</hi> you ſay, did not reſt upon the Moſaicall types, neither doubtleſſe did all the non elect <hi>Jewes</hi> reſt upon them: but having the knowledge of the true meanes of their ſalvation, did many of them ſeemingly, though not ſavingly, embrace it. And what though the elect <hi>Jewes</hi> did believe the remiſſion of their ſins, and the redemption of their ſoules by Chriſt; and that he was to be wounded for their tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dyed in this Faith, and could not be forc't to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it by any torments? Did they therefore believe no more then this? Did they therefore not believe that Chriſt ſhould reigne with them, as well as ſuffer for them? nor that they ſhould reign with him, as well as ſuffer with him? what! ſhall we think that they were not to reigne on Earth, becauſe 'tis ſaid in theſe texts, that they beleeved the remiſſion of their finnes, and the ſalvation
<pb facs="tcp:113937:10"/>of their ſoules after their departure? Certainly wee are taught otherwiſe. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that yee which have followed mee, in the regeneration, when the Sonne of man ſhall ſit on the Throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. In which words there is their reigne, <hi>Ye ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi> And the time of their reigne, ſaid to be, firſt, in the regeneration, that is, in the time, when the ſinnes of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be blotted out: in the time when Chriſt ſhall come and <hi>turne away ungodlineſſe from Jacob,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and ſecondly, which is coincident with this, <hi>when the Sonne of man ſhall ſit on the Throne of his glory.</hi> That is, when Chriſt himſelfe ſhall come to reigne: when at the laſt Trumpet, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this world ſhall become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt. This is the Maſters voyce, and the voyce of his ſervants is like unto it. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne with him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 12. and chapter 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Henceforth there is layd up for mee a Crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to mee onely, but to them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Thou haſt made us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on Earth,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John.</hi> Now the firſt of theſe texts ſhewes, that the Saints ſhall be Kings; the ſecond, when they ſhall be Kings, to wit, at Chriſts appearing, when they ſhall receive their Crownes. And the third (beſides this) ſhewes where they ſhall be Kings, to wit, on Earth. I ſay beſides this, for it ſhewes expreſſely alſo, that they ſhall be Kings: and infallibly too, when they ſhall be Kings; ſeeing it is ſaid, <hi>and we ſhall reigne on earth.</hi> Which propheticall words doe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto us, a reign that the Saints ſhould enjoy on Earth, and not a reigne that they did then enjoy, and conſequently, a reigne to follow their reſurrection, and not to goe before it. And when the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 14.15.16. doth alledge this as a reaſon, to ſhew that the Patriarchs did <hi>deſire an Heavenly Countrey,</hi> to wit, becauſe they did not returne to the Countrey from whence they came out, which they might have done if they would; what Countrey is this <hi>heavenly Countrey</hi> ſo likely to be, as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> which they did expect to poſſeſſe, when they and it ſhould be reſtor'd to an heavenly condition? for doubtleſſe had Heaven it

And beſides this, you give the Reader notice, how apt you are to wreſt the Scriptures, by the plaine converſion, which you have made of the text, Acts. 15. verſe 11. for you apply it to the Jewes under the Law, ſaying, they beleeved that through the grace of our lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhould be ſaved, even as we, when as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wee beleeve, that through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhalbe ſaved, even as they,</hi> and ſo ſhews the Jewes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, that they ſhould as well be ſaved by faith in Chriſt, without the ceremonies of the Law; as their Fathers had been by this faith under the ceremonies of the Law: and the text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. verſe 22. which you apply to the redemption of the faithfull from etternall torments by the death of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> is meant of Gods delivering of them, out of temporal calamities and afflictions, as the foregoing verſes doe plainely ſhew. And laſtly your argument touching old Simeon, <hi>[that he craved no longer life, to raigne with Chriſt on earth]</hi> doth make as much againſt his beliefe of Chriſts ſpirituall, as his perſonall raigne, and againſt his beliefe of Chriſts ſuffering, as againſt either of theſe: and ſurely though he prayed to depart, becauſe it was revealed unto him, that he ſhould not ſee death before he had ſeen the Lord Chriſt; yet the teſtimony he gave of Chriſt, that <hi>he ſhould be the glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> (which doth as well intimate the generall converſion of the Jewes, and Chriſts raigning amongſt them, as his being <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> doth imply the converſion of the Gentiles) this teſtimony, I ſay, doth ſhew, that <hi>Simeon</hi> did hope to live againe, to raigne with Chriſt; although he did then deſire to depart, having ſeen him. And to this hope of the Saints, as well as to the hope of the
<pb facs="tcp:113937:12"/>glory, which ſhall follow their reigne, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, when he ſaith, that others of the faithfull Jewes, <hi>were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtaine a better reſurrection.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:113937:12"/>the Noble-mans going into a farre countrey to receive for himſelf a Kingdom, and returne; which he put forth of purpoſe, becauſe the Jewes did looke for the immediate appearing of his Kingdom; by that parable, I ſay, he did as good as tell them, that they did rightly conceive of the nature of his Kingdom, but not of the time when it ſhould appeare: that they truely thought, he ſhould raigne viſibly over them on earth, though they were deceived in expecting the accompliſhment of it, then at his firſt coming. For what was the Kingdom of God which the Jewes thought ſhuld immediately appeare? was it the glory that ſhall follow the Judgment of the dead? doubtleſſe they thought not that the Judgment of the dead, ſhould immediately enſue.

The Kingdom of God then, which they ſo earneſtly and ſo ſoone expected, muſt needs be the Kingdom which God had foretold, that Chriſt ſhould govern per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally on earth, when he ſhould be ſet by him on the Throne of his Father <hi>David.</hi> For indeed Chriſt can bring with him no other Kingdom for himſelf, (that is, no other Kingdom to govern as man) but this, from that farre countrey, whither he is gone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for himſelf a Kingdom, and to returne. And therefore twas not their looking <hi>[through theſe ſpectacles]</hi> as you phraſe the proper expoſition of the prophecies, that made them to deny, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, but rather ſtumbling at his meane condition onely, they did to him, <hi>what Gods hand and Counſell had determined before to be done.</hi> And as the Jewes were no example of misbeliefe, in looking for their deliverance from captivity, and for our Saviours perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all raigne amongſt them: ſo doubtleſſe the proper acception of the prophecies concerning our Saviours raigne, did no more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> to miſtake his natures, and deny his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; then the proper acceptions of the prophecies concerning his incarnation &amp; ſuffering did: and therefore ſeeing it is not poſſible that the true underſtanding of one part of the Scripture, ſhould thruſt us into the miſapprehenſion of another part thereof; we may well thinke, that it was the want of a due conſideration of thoſe texts, which doe demonſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Fiftly, Vpon this occaſion the Apoſtle John wrote the Goſpel again, and more largely then any other of the Euangeliſts ſpeakes of Chriſts Godhead, his wonderfull workes, his Kingdom, reſurrection, and his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, eſpecially that the Sonne of man is now glorified, chap.</hi> 13.31. <hi>that he hath overcome the world, chap.</hi> 16.33. <hi>that his Kingdom is not of this world, and if his Kingdom were of this world, his ſervants would fight, that he ſhould not be delivered unto the Jewes, but now is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not from hence, chap.</hi> 18.36. <hi>And of the condition of his Subjects, he ſaith, Remember the word that I ſaid unto you, the ſervant is not greater then the Lord, if they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you, chap.</hi> 15.20. <hi>verily</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, yee ſhall weepe and lament, and the world ſhall rejoyce, and you ſhalbe ſorrowfull, but your ſorrow ſhal be turned into joy: theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that in me yee might have peace, in the world you ſhall have tribulation: but be of good cheere, chap.</hi> 16.20.33. <hi>And of his coming againe he ſaith, In my Fathers houſe are many manſions—if I goe and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there yee may be alſo, chap.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Now you have ſorrow, but I will ſee you againe, and your heart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and your joy no man taketh from you chap.</hi> 16 22. <hi>All which words were written flatly againſt the errours of Cerinthus, and teach us that Chriſt's Kingdom is not an earthly Kingdom, nor delayed for one or two</hi> 1000. <hi>yeeres; but now is his kingdom, now he hath overcome the world, his ſubjects are not to live on earth without perſecution and ſorrow, and when he comes againe, he will receive them with him into his Fathers manſions, and their ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy that ſhall never be taken from them.</hi>

                  <label>Anſwer.</label> That you have made a falſe report of the occaſion of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> writing of his Goſpell, and conſequently of the end and ſcope of the texts here alledged, the words of our Engliſh Divines, who are the Authors of the Annotations upon all the bookes of the old
<pb facs="tcp:113937:13"/>and new Teſtaments, printed 1645. do plainely declare. For in their argument of the Goſpel according to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> they ſay. That in <hi>Domitians</hi> time he was baniſhed into the Iſle Pathmos, where he wrote the Revelation; after which under <hi>Nerva,</hi> he was recal'd to <hi>Epheſus</hi> (being aged about 97. yeares, which was the 100. yeare of our Lord) where he wrote his Goſpel; ſome ſay, at the intreaty of the Chriſtians of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for the refutation of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and others, who blaſphemouſly denied the Deity of Chriſt. This is their teſtimony of the ground of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John's</hi> writing his Goſpel; wherein they tell us not, as you doe, that it was becauſe of <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and others opinion of Chriſts 1000 yeeres reigne in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; But that it was, as hiſtory reports, becauſe of his and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers denying the Deity of Chriſt. Your quotations follow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt, That the Son of man is now glorified, was ſpoken by our Saviour, when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone to betray him: and doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the glory, which was then ſudenly to follow both in his death, and after his death, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> notes: and will his comming againe or his reigning after his comming, unglorify him, thinke you? certainely no: but will manifeſt unto the whole world, the glory which he hath received; For he ſhall come in the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. verſe. 27. <hi>And ſhall ſit on the Throne of his glory,</hi> when he is come, as he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. verſe. 28. which Throne, the comparing of this text with the 28, and 29 verſes of the 22. chap. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke,</hi> doth ſhew to be meant of the Throne of his Kingdom. The next words, that he hath overcome the world, he ſpake to comfort his Diſciples againſt the tribulation which they ſhould have in the world: and they doe ſignifie, that as in himſelfe he had and could overcome the temptations of the world, ſo hee would in them too, by ſtrengthning them to endure to the end for his ſake, what he had voluntarily reſolved to endure for their ſakes. And how is this his overcomming of the world by patience, in the time of his temptation, any let or hinderance to his overcomming of it by power, to his reigning over it, at his next appearing? The third text, That his Kingdom is not of this world &amp;c. was his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he askt him, whether he was the <hi>King of the Jewes.</hi> And it doth ſhew onely, that he was not to receive his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to reigne, of men, but of God (as I obſerve in my reply.) This is your firſt file of proofes; the ſecond doth conſiſt of ſuch texts, as
<pb facs="tcp:113937:14"/>ſhew that the faithfull moſt ſuffer perſecution in this world, as Chriſt did: and doubtleſſe they muſt till Chriſts comming againe, at which time they ſhalbe delivered from all their oppreſſions, and preſſures, and become Rulers of the world themſelves. And ſo theſe texts doe make directly againſt the reigne of the Saints now, while the tribulations of this world endure: but nothing againſt the reigne of the Saints, when the tribulations of it ſhall ceaſe. Your laſt file of proofes is brought to ſhew, that when Chriſt comes the Saints ſhalbe with him, where he is: and that their joy ſhalbe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. And what repugnancy is there betwixt theſe things and our Saviours reigning on earth? certainly they ſhalbe ever with him on earth, when he comes againe, on this earth while he reignes, and on the new earth (of which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter.</hi> ſpeakes, 2. Epiſt. 3. verſe 13.) after his reigne; for to that earth the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> (in which the Saints ſhall live after the laſt Judgment) ſhall deſcend, as it is revealed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 verſe 2. and when Chriſt himſelfe ſhalbe their companion, and ſin and death have no more power over them, how ſhould their being on earth deprive them of their joy? but yet the text chap. 16. verſe 22. is by <hi>Piſcator</hi> referred to the joy that the Diſciples received both through the ſight of Chriſt after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and through the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, * which he then breathed on them: and not to the joy which they ſhall receive at their owne reſurrection, when Chriſt comes againe. And thus it appeares, that you might as truly have ſaid, that all the new Teſtament was written againſt Chriſts perſonal reigne on earth, as that the Goſpel of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John</hi> was.</p>

Apocal. pag. 285) ſaith of it: which things though we imbrace not, yet we cannot condemne, becauſe many faithfull perſons, and Martyrs of the Church have ſaid them. However, it was as eaſie for <hi>Euſebius</hi> or any other, to condemne <hi>Papias</hi> for a man of ſmall judgment, as it is for you, to ſay, <hi>[that our arguments are ſo ſilly and ridiculous, that every underſtanding perſon reading them, findes not onely the weakneſſe of the grounds, but even out of them doth gather pregnant arguments in the contrary]</hi> twas as eaſie, I ſay, for <hi>Euſebius</hi> to write the foreſaid words, as it is for you to write theſe, albeit the Reader may plainly ſee, that you doe but ſlander our arguments herein. For beſides the plaine texts and prophecies in the new Teſtament, there are far more prophecies in the old, to ſhew our Saviours corporal reigne on earth, then there are to ſhew his birth and death, and as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered to the underſtanding. But be it as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, [that <hi>Papias</hi> was a man of ſmal judgment] yet that he ſhewed it not in being of this opinion, not onely the Scriptures, but the judgment of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, who followed him in it, doe atteſt: of whom we cannot intertaine ſuch an unjuſt beliefe, as to thinke, that they would prize the antiquity and authority of <hi>Papias</hi> word, above the authority and antiquity of the word of God it ſelfe. But that this truth might be univerſally abhorred, and rejected as an error after the 320. yeare of our Lord, we eaſily beleeve. For it is unqueſtionable, that many a truth and error did change titles each with other, as popiſh ignorance, ſuperſtition and idolatry grew in requeſt, and needs then muſt this truth, which aſcribes the accompliſhment of the predictions of Chriſts Kingly Office to their right owner, ſoone vaniſh out of mens minds, and leeſe its luſtre and repute; whenas that Man of ſin was ſhortly to appeare, who to exalt his power above all that is called God, ſhould as blaſphemouſly, as deceitfully, apply theſe prophecies to himſelfe. And laſtly, that we agree not in all circumſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this opinion, doth no more derogate from the truth and worth of it; then the differences that are amongſt other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe derogate from the truth and neceſſity of any ſubject wherein they doe diſagree.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:113937:16"/>Gentiles, can be no patterne to expound thoſe which ſpeake parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Jewes, and of the houſe of <hi>Levi:</hi> and that you alledge ſuch pregnant prophecies for the reſtoring of ſacrifices, why ſhould we not beleeve this alſo? what abſurdity will ariſe from ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe? certainely we know as well as you, that they are now unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but it will not follow from hence, that they ſhall never be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full againe: unleſſe it can be be proved, that God cannot againe command, what he did ſometimes forbid; or that he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the uſe of a thing at ſeverall times, for ſeverall ends: or that God hath in his word forbid the uſe of theſe things at any time hereafter, to wit, as well after the comming of Chriſt, as before it: neither of which I preſume can eaſily be maintained. And as for that prophecy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>verſe</hi> 53. &amp;c. which is your other maine pillar to ſupport the figurative ſenſe of all the prophecies in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: and to beare down our proper and naturall conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: it hath indeed not the ſubſtance but the ſound of an argument onely, and makes much againſt you, but nought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. For firſt, it ſhews them to be in an error who affirme, that the captivity of <hi>Samaria,</hi> of the ten Tribes is already return'd. And ſecondly, it is more forcible to diſprove the Jewes returne from <hi>Babylon</hi> (againſt which alſo it may be alledged) then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their future returne from all countreys. For the 60. and 61. <hi>verſe. Nevertheleſſe, I will remember my Covenant with thee in the daies of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting Covenant. Then thou ſhalt remember thy wayes, and be aſhamed, when thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy ſiſters, thine elder and thy younger, and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant.</hi> Theſe words doe ſhew that this captivity of Jeruſalem ſhould returne againe, and at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne receive her ſiſters <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Samaria;</hi> and therefore the words, <hi>verſe</hi> 53. <hi>when I ſhall bring againe their captivity, the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sodom and her daughters,</hi> &amp;c. doe ſhew onely, that this prophecie doth ſpeake of the captivity and deſolation of Jeruſalem and her adjacent cities &amp; villages by the <hi>Romans;</hi> from which they ſhould no more be reſtor'd, til <hi>Samaria</hi> and her adjacent cities &amp; villages ſhould be reſtored, and inhabited by the Iſraelites, by the ten Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, whoſe future returne is witneſſed by ſo many evident prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and untill the place where <hi>Sodom</hi> and her cities ſtood, ſhould againe become a fruitfull land and full of inhabitants, as the 55.

What I have done here is for your good: for</hi> 1. <hi>you have heard this error preached inſtead of the Doctrine of Chriſt, (albeit it was firſt preached by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt) by ſome of the Authours of the</hi> Apologetical-nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>for</hi> Independency, <hi>who had in their Congregation not onely</hi> Millenaries, <hi>but groſſe</hi> Anabaptiſts: <hi>and ſo their practice manifeſtly declares, what they writ obſcurely in that</hi> Narration pag. 12. <hi>ſaying,</hi> we tooke meaſure of no mans holineſſe by his opinion, whether adverſe unto us &amp;c. <hi>Their</hi> Dinah <hi>is liberty of conſcience: their grand ammunition is Anarchie or no diſcipline, and they call it a bondage to be tied in the faith.</hi> 2. <hi>The booke of M.</hi> Maton <hi>called</hi> Iſraels Redemption, <hi>hath been oft put into your hands, and upon ſeverall occaſions of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the truth in this point, you have been intreated to put that booke into my hand; wherefore you have need of an Autidote. Peruſe this plaine refutation of it: wherby I hope, you ſhall ſee, that the reward of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt is not meate that periſheth, but everlaſting life,</hi> which the Sonne of man ſhall give unto you, Joh. 6.27. <hi>and that the Kingdom of God comes not with obſervation [or worldly reſpect and attendance]

                  <label>Anſwer.</label> Beloved in the Lord, you are told here by Mr. <hi>Petry</hi> [that this hiſtorical <hi>Narration</hi> of the original of the <hi>Millenarian Tenet, and his refutation of my booke, are for your good.</hi>] And had it been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I had not now anſwered the one or repli'd unto the other; yea I had rather laid my hand upon my mouth; or empoly'd it about the publique retractation of mine own opinion. But I find not in either, ought of that ſincere and upright dealing, as is pretended in theſe words. That which I ſinde is this, that Mr. <hi>Petrie,</hi> is too much of the minde of the Lawyers in the Goſpel, of whom our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 52. <hi>that they had taken away the key of knowledge, that they entred not in themſelves, and them that were entring in, they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi> And, that as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> beſt project to diſcountenance our Saviours miracles, was to ſay, that he did <hi>caſt out Devils through Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils:</hi> and their moſt prevalent motive to diſgrace his doctrine, was to ſay, that he was <hi>a glutton, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners:</hi> So Mr. <hi>Petrie's</hi> chiefeſt ſleight to diſparage the truth we hold, is to ſay, <hi>[that it hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father, nor abettours, but heretiques:</hi> that it is preacht by ſuch as have in their Congregation, groſſe <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and are friends to whatſoever <hi>Novellers.</hi> And that it teacheth the voluptuous &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall living of the raiſed Saints, and their dying againe after they are raiſed.] And doubtleſſe, beloved, if you ſhould be as ready to receive theſe tares into your hearts, as Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> is to ſow them there; your eares would be ſtuſſed with prejudice, and your hearts choakt up with indignation againſt us: but as we wiſh better things unto you, ſo we hope better things of you, <hi>even ſuch things as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation.</hi> We hope, I ſay, that you are as wiſe as the <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:113937:19"/>of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they were noble, in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word with all readineſſe of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> And if you examine our words by this rule, by which the <hi>Bereans</hi> examined S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul's</hi> (and were ſo highly commended by him for it) we doubt not but you will with one conſent affirme, That in the point in Queſtion, we, and not our adverſaries, doe ſay as God ſaith. <hi>And that we make not the meate that periſheth, but everlaſting life,</hi> the reward of the glorified Saints, although we truly affirme, that theſe Saints may, and ſhall eate &amp; drinke after their reſurrection. As it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>verſe</hi> 29. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.18. And that you will affirme too, that we truly hold, that the Kingdom of God is not yet come, although our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. <hi>verſe</hi> 20. anſwered the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who demanded, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come, <hi>that the Kingdom of God was within, or amongſt them.</hi> For that which our Saviour there cal'd the Kingdom of God, is not meant of the Kingdom it ſelfe (of which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> inquired) but of the outward meanes by which that Kingdom is obtain'd. As it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>verſe</hi> 43. and thus alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>righteouſneſſe and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are cald the Kingdom of God, becauſe theſe things doe intitle men to that Kingdom, and manifeſt unto others, that they doe belong unto it: neither of which the obſerving, or not obſerving of difference in meats and drinks can doe. And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 20. it is ſaid, <hi>The Kingdom of God, is not in word, but in power,</hi> that is, our intereſt in the Kingdom of God, is neither obtained, nor atteſted by our diſccurſing, preaching, and profeſſing of the truth onely, but by our carefull and conſcionable performance of thoſe things which wee are commanded. And therefore, beloved, that you may not miſtake the meanes and evidences of God's Kingdom, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelfe; but may by the injoyment and effectual uſe of theſe, be aſſured in your ſelves, and make knowne unto others, that you are heires of that; that you have an inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God; <hi>we beſeech the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the word of Chriſt may dwell in you richly in all wiſdom;</hi> and that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, and God even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace, may comfort your hearts, and ſtabliſh you in every good word, and worke.</p>

And it is becauſe he is the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> (and not of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or any other heathen Prince) that he is to ſit on <hi>David's</hi> Throne.

And doe not ſay, but ſhew, that the proper expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the propheſies, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne our Saviours and the Saints viſible reigne on earth: the converſion, deliverance, and eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their owne land: the deſtruction of their oppoſers, and ſubjection of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto them: in a word, which reveale unto us the chiefeſt events and alterations, that ſhall come to paſſe over the whole

For ſurely if our proper expoſition of theſe predictions doth teach ought of all this we may well be accounted for publiſhers of a new Goſpel; but if it doth teach nought of this you your ſelfe are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be accounted but a partial preacher of the Goſpel; a preacher but of a part of the Counſell of God: tel us therfore what article of faith, or plaine text of Scripture, or moral duty, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd or oppugned, by the beliefe of our Sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tel us too, whether the knowledge of theſe things be a frivolous and unneceſſary knowledge, or a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not belonging unto godlineſſe. Certainly we cannot conceive how the perſonal reigne of Chriſt on earth, ſhould any way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge or weaken his ſpiritual power, or abbreviate his Kingdom; or that his Church ſhould be leſſe glorious, when he comes into the world unto it, then it hath been ſince he departed out of the world, or can be, as long as he is abſent from it. And we know that by our proper expoſition of theſe prophecies, we doe make a juſt diſtribution of the word of God: that we give unto the <hi>Jew,</hi> whatſoever belongs unto the <hi>Jew;</hi> and to the <hi>Gentile,</hi> whatſoever belongs unto the <hi>Gentile:</hi> whereas you by your proper interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prophecies which concerne the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and your figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expoſition of the prophecies which concerne the <hi>Jewes;</hi> doe keepe your owne things to your ſelfe and make the mercies prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for others to be common mercies: yea to be as much, or more yours then theirs. And as you hereby impoſe a figurative ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpiritual part of the promiſes made unto the <hi>Jewes;</hi> ſo you impoſe a double figurative ſenſe upon the temporal part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto them. For firſt you interpret thoſe outward and earthly promiſes (as you call them) of ſpirituall bleſſinges too; and being ſo interpreted, you underſtand them of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as wel, or rather then of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And this you make figurative ſpeeches where you finde none; and may indeed as eaſily make a figurative ſpeech of any ſpeech, as thus interpret theſe prophecies. But it is not the figurative and metaphorical oppreſſion of a prophecy, that
<pb facs="tcp:113937:24"/>doth make the prophecy to carry a figurative ſenſe: for both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual promiſes may be figuratively and metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſt, but yet they are not to be figuratively underſtood; that is, prophecies of temporal things (however expreſt) are not to be underſtood of ſpiritual bleſſings: neither are prophecies of ſpiritual or temporal things (whether figuratively or properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt) to be underſtood of any beſides thoſe of whom they are plainly prophecied. In a word, prophecies (however expreſt) are to be underſtood, of what they ſpeake, where they ſpeake of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, they are to be underſtood onely of temporal things: and where they ſpeake of ſpiritual things, they are to be underſtood onely of ſpiritual things. And of whom they ſpeake, where they ſpeak plainly of Chriſt, they are to be underſtood of Chriſt onely: and where they ſptake plainly of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely: and where they ſpeake plainly of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they are to be underſtood of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely: and where they ſpeake generally and indifferently of both, they are to be underſtood of both. And in like manner, where they ſpeake plainly of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Sion,</hi> they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of them onely.</p>
               <p>Thus much for your rules, (which whoſoever ſhall embrace, he will doubtleſſe be no better friend to the truth we hold, then you your ſelfe are) that which follows is your explication of theſe words <hi>Amos</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>They ſhall no more be pulled up out of their land, which I have given them, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Which paſſage you anſwer; Firſt, by that text <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. [where you ſay, <hi>we have the ſame promiſe, but expreſſed with a condition.</hi>] How? the ſame promiſe? certainly the promiſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> was made to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before ſhe went into captivity, before that judgement was come upon her for her abominations. But the promiſe in <hi>Amos</hi> is made to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after ſhe ſhould come out of captivity, after the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſhould ceaſe. And whereas you ſay further, <hi>[that it is uſuall in the Scriptures, that earthly promiſes are expreſſed ſometime with a condition, and ſometime without it, but are alwaies underſtood conditionally]</hi> It is to be noted, that here you confeſſe the promiſe <hi>Amos</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 14, 15. to be an earthly or outward promiſe, and conditionally underſtood; which <hi>pag.</hi> 8. you interpret of <hi>[ſpiritual houſes and benefites:]</hi> as you doe alſo that text <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. in
<pb facs="tcp:113937:24"/>your preface, and others in other places. And yet it is not true, that all outward and earthly promiſes, are conditional promiſes: for thoſe which are mixed with ſpiritual promiſes (as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. <hi>verſe</hi> 37. &amp;c. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>verſe</hi> 24. &amp;c. and in many other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies) or that doe contemporate with ſuch outward and bodily promiſes, as are mixed with ſpiritual promiſes, as this of <hi>Amos</hi> doth; thoſe earthly promiſes, I ſay, cannot be conditional promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſeeing the ſpiritual promiſes with which they contemporate, are promiſes of the condition it ſelf. And therfore the prophecy of <hi>Amos, chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. &amp;c. is an abſolute prophecy, a prophecy hereafter to be fullfild, <hi>when the Spirit of God ſhalbe powred on the Jewes from on high,</hi> as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. <hi>verſe</hi> 15. &amp;c. And not a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall prophecy, a prophecy formerly canceld for want of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you anſwer the foreſaid text of <hi>Amos,</hi> by ſhewing a different acception of the word [<hi>land,</hi> which you ſay, as it is not <hi>alwaies expounded of the earth, ſo ſometimes it is put for the grave, and for Heaven.</hi>] But the inſtances by which you would prove this, doe faile you very much; for (beſides that mens graves are in the earth) it is not the word <hi>[land]</hi> of it ſelfe, but this phraſe of ſpeech <hi>[the land of darkeneſſe]</hi> that is put for the grave <hi>Job,</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. and <hi>[the land of the living]</hi> that is uſ'd <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>verſe</hi> 13. which doth not ſignify Heaven, as the Authours of the Engliſh annotations on the whole <hi>Bible</hi> printed 1645. doe obſerve, but the ſurface of the earth, on which the living are: at <hi>[the land of darkeneſſe]</hi> doth a place under the ſuperficies of the earth, where the bodies of the dead remaine. And happily <hi>David</hi> ſpake here of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in relation to the time, in which Chriſt himſelfe and all the Saints that are to come with him, ſhould have their abode in it: in which reſpect, as it may properly, ſo it may very fitly too be cald <hi>[the land of the living]</hi> of the living that ſhall die no more. But if this phraſe did ſignify Heaven, as you ſay, yet it will no more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from theſe words, <hi>[that the land of Canaan was a type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven]</hi> then it will follow from thoſe in the 10. of <hi>Job,</hi> that it was a type of the grave. And ſure we are that <hi>Amos</hi> prophecy is to be fullfild in the land, whither the text ſaith that <hi>the Iſraelites ſhall returne from their captivity, and where they ſhall build themſelves houſes, and plant vineyards, from which they ſhall no more be carried captives,
<pb facs="tcp:113937:25"/>as they have formerly been.</hi> For the meaning of there words, <hi>that they ſhall no more be pulled up out of their land,</hi> is parallel with that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 44. <hi>that their Kingdom ſhall not be left to other people.</hi> And here alſo it is to be noted, that this part of your anſwer doth croſſe the former part. For there you ſay, that this prophecy of <hi>Amos [was a conditional prophecy,]</hi> and ſo not accompliſhed for want of obedience in the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and yet here you ſay, <hi>[that they were brought againe into their land, and that they were not pulled out of their land, but are planted in their true land, whence they ſhall no more be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out:]</hi> ſo that here you exalt thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> up to Heaven, which before you did thruſt downe to Hell, for not fulfilling the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required of them, and therfore you muſt know your owne minde better in underſtanding the Scripture, and ſpeake more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly, and truly, then you doe in this inference, before you can fruſtrate the marginal note in the 9. page of my booke.</p>

For then they ſhould beleeve Jeſus to be the Chriſt as well as we, which as yet they doe not, and by this we may ſee, that if you had not quite altered our meaning by adding the word [Jeſus] (and ſo confounded and obſcur'd, what wee have clearly and diſtinctly delivered) you could have ſaid nothing to what we ſay. For you would have been aſham'd I ſuppoſe, to have uttered your aſſertion thus, <hi>[It was never yet heard, that the Jewes doe beleeve, that Chriſt ſhall come as a King]</hi> which yet is all that we affirme, But having thus made your ſelfe worke, you goe on and tell us <hi>[They ſaid, Away with him, we will not have him to reigne over us]</hi> True, but this ſhews onely, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> then denied Jeſus to be the Chriſt; &amp; that the <hi>Jewes</hi> now continuing in the ſame blindnes, are guilty of the ſame tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; but it ſhewes not, that either the ancient <hi>Jewes</hi> did not, or that the modern doe not beleeve that Chriſt ſhall come as a King. You goe on <hi>[They ſay that the Meſſias ſhall come, but they ſpeake not of his comming twice or thrice; looke all the Iewiſh Rabbies, and aſke them who are alive: they will ſay, but once.]</hi> Let them that deny it take this paines; but what though they ſay, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is to come but once? what will follow from hence? ſurely this will follow, that as long as they continue to beleeve ſo, they cannot beleeve that Jeſus ſhall come as a King, becauſe they know that he is already
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113937:28"/>come. But it wil not follow from hence, that they doe not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall come as a King. And thus notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your Magiſteriall Querie, your foiſted aſſertion, and ought elſe that you have ſaid, it is very evident, that the <hi>conceit of Chriſt's comming to reigne,</hi> is both Chriſtian and Jewiſh: Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, becauſe Chriſtians beleeve it, (as plainly reveal'd in Gods word) although you account it no part of a Chriſtians beliefe; and Jewiſh, becauſe the Jewes beleeve, that Chriſt ſhall ſo come, although they beleeve not, that he is already come. And therefore it is neither abhorred of all Chriſtians, nor of any Jewes, ſo far are they both from rejecting it. Yea ſo well doe they agree in the truth of this particular, That Chriſt ſhall come as a King: although, as yet they diſagree about his perſon: and conſequently in all that the Goſpel reveales to be already done by him.</p>

                     <p>The Querie comprehended both, becauſe both are intimated in the Querie, and doe neceſſarily follow from the Querie. And you have not ſhewed us any Querie, that affirms nothing; nor in what ſenſe this Querie doth affirme nothing. In the asked matter, there is the Kingdom to be reſtored; and from hence proceeds the firſt aſſertion. And the perſon that ſhould reſtore it; and from hence proceeds the ſecond aſſertion. But the firſt is not here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended you ſay, <hi>[becauſe the Querie is of the Kingdom of Iſrael, and not of the Jewes]</hi> as if the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Kingdom of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not to be underſtood of the ſame people. No, ſay you. For [<hi>all are not Iſraelites who are of Iſrael, Rom.</hi> 9.6.] a worthy reaſon: for it is as if you ſhould ſay; by the Kingdom of Iſrael, cannot be meant the Kingdom of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe all that are Iſraelites by birth, are not elect Iſraelites, Iſraelites accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, and according to faith alſo.

                        </gap> the meaning of the text cited by you <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. and ſo proves not, that the Kingdom in the text belongs to any other people, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or nation, but the <hi>Jewes</hi> (of whom alone interpreters doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.) And therefore you ſhould have ſpoken out, and told us plainly, what the other Kingdom you ſpeake of was. For we know of no more but two, beſides this in Queſtion betwixt us. And theſe are commonly cal'd the <hi>Kingdom of grace,</hi> by which is meant, the Saints or Church on earth before Chriſts appearing. And the Kingdom of glory, by which is meant the Saints or Church in Heaven. And that neither of theſe Kingdoms is meant in the text, I prove thus.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113937:30"/>Which is our firſt aſſertion. And the other is comprehended here too: For although the Querie [askes not of his ſecond comming, but of now;] yet ſeeing Chriſt was to reſtore it, and did it not while he was on earth, it neceſſarily follows, that he ſhall doe it at his deſcending againe to the earth. Which is our ſecond aſſertion: and thus both are found in the text. And beſides, if you take the word 8 [as, <hi>all are not Iſrael, who are of Iſrael</hi>] in the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>i. e.</hi> all are not faithfull Iſraelites, that are deſcended of Iſrael: then it is an apparent tautology to add, <hi>[ſo neither are they all Iſraelites, or the children of God, [that are of Iſrael according to the flaſh]</hi> and if you doe not take the Apoſtles words in this ſenſe; then it is notoriouſly falſe to ſay, that all are not Iſraelites, to wit, by nation; who are of Iſrael by birth.

                     <p n="1">1. Me thinks you might as wel have ſhewed the non-ſenſe, as ſaid it was non-ſenſe. But [many expoſitours, you ſay, expone theſe words otherwiſe] This ſhews not that I have ſpoken non-ſenſe, in ſaying, that I have met with no ſuch. But I doubt it ſhews, that you ſpeake an untruth, which is worſe then non-ſenſe. For you might as eaſily have nam'd ſome of them, as have ſaid it, and bid me looke them out. And had there been any, I preſume you would too, ſeeing it is not likely, that they would have brought an expoſition different from that which was commonly received by others, and have given no reaſon for it, or one no better then [a <hi>why may we not think ſo?</hi>] 2. If you thinke that theſe places here quoted be diverſly interpreted, (as your disjunctive conjunction <hi>[OR]</hi> intimates, and yet ſay, <hi>[why may not this Kingdom be taken, as the thiefe meant, or as Chriſt meant, or as Simeon meant?]</hi> any one may perceive, that you are altogether unreſolved what ſenſe to take it in: but had rather take it in any ſenſe, then that we take it in. And if you thinke that all theſe places have but one meaning, (as the laſt words of this part of your anſwer imply) you ſhould have ſhewed us what it had been. For in our Saviour's and <hi>Simeon's</hi> words, the word <hi>[Kingdom]</hi> is not found. And the words which you take to be equivalent with it, are diverſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in our Saviour's words, is interpreted to be Heaven. And ſalvation and Glory, in <hi>Simeon's</hi> ſong doe ſignify,

                        <hi>Salutis et gloriae authorem,</hi> the authour of glory, and the authour of ſalvation; to wit, Chriſt himſelfe. So that if the Kingdom in the Apoſtles Querie be expounded either of theſe two waies, it is all one as if they had ſaid, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore Heaven to Iſrael?</hi> or, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore thy ſelfe to Iſrael?</hi> And as for the Kingdom the theife ſpake of, we thanke you for menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of it. And doe willingly grant, that the Apoſtles underſtood it as he did. But how was that? ſurely as all other <hi>Jewes</hi> did, of a Kingdom on earth, and not in Heaven. For his words in the original are, <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore it muſt needs follow, that he underſtood it of an earthly Kingdom, which all <hi>Jewes</hi> expected; and (as it ſeemes by the Apoſtles Querie) all beleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> thought ſhould ſuddenly appeare after his reſurrection. But becauſe it was not to be ſo, therefore it was, that our Saviour promiſed the theife the preſent happineſſe of his ſoule in Heaven: where it ſhould remaine in his preſence, until at his comming in his Kingdom (of which he had ſpoken) he ſhould bring it with him, to be reunited to his glorified body: and ſo, according to his requeſt he ſhould in his whole manhood be made partaker of his Maſter's glorious reigne on earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 You muſt give us leave to thinke, that no expoſitour doth deny it, until either we can find; or you, or others ſhew us ſuch a one.

                     <p>This cauſe is no miſtaking, for the Queſtion muſt needs be granted; and that even becauſe Chriſt's words have nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely of that point; unleſſe you will be ſo irreverent, as to think, that Chriſt who reprehended them onely for a curious deſire to know when this thing ſhould be; would not much rather have reprehended them, for miſunderſtanding of the thing it ſelfe, if it ſhould not have been. Yea doubtleſſe if it ſhould not have been, he could not have ſaid, <hi>It is not for you to know the times, and the ſeaſons.</hi> Seeing that which ſhall never be, can have no time nor ſeaſon. And thus while you grant that Chriſt did reprehend their curioſity, in ſeeking to know the time when Iſrael ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd; and yet deny, that he did therein grant Iſrael ſhould be reſtor'd; you make him ſay, that there ſhould be a time for that which ſhould never be: and ſo in effect, put the ly upon him. So
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113937:33"/>much have you over-ſhot your ſelfe in denying, that the ſubject in the Queſtion is granted, becauſe our Saviour doth expreſly ſay nothing of it.

And therfore alſo the Apoſtles meant ſomething that was true; for that knowledge is not curious, which thinks it knows ſomething, when it knows nothing, or which knows the truth; but that which would know more then it ought to know touching ſome truths. And thus it appears that the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe in this reaſon, which you have cunningly conceal'd from the readers ſight, is not vaine, but valid.</p>

And this reaſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for the ſame purpoſe. For whereas our Saviour gave a ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per anſwer here to the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> then he did to the Apoſtles, and yet granted withall, that the thing they ſpake for ſhould be given to ſome, it is altogether unlikely that where he uſed a milder reproofe, he did therby deny, that the thing which was askt ſhould at any time be done: eſpecially ſeeing in both anſwers, it was for the motives of their asking onely, and not for the matter, that they were reprehended.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:113937:38"/>whom thy children ſhall ſmite, and deliver up unto death: and for this offence will the Lord give them up both to captivity and infidelity, untill the Church of thoſe Gentiles, which during the time of thy blindneſſe ſhall be taken into thy roome, hath brought forth all her children: and then again ſhall the remaining Iſraelites return both unto the faith, and inheritance of the ancient Iſraelites.</hi> Thus I, and You as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, ye numerous enemies of the Jews, and lay ſiege againſt them, and ſmite and abuſe their Rulers, but yet, O ye Jews, be of good comfort, and regard not this calansity which is coming on you, for you ſhall have a more powerfull Ruler then ever you had, born in Bethleem Ephrata: and therefore you ſhall be given into the enemies hand, and carried away captives into Babylon, there to remain, untill the daughter of Zion, who ſhall be in pain and labour to bring forth like a woman in travail, ſhall be delivered there of them, whom the Lord ſhall redeem from the hand of their enemies, and bring into their own land. And then ſhall the Gentiles adjoyn themſelves to the Jews, and both ſhall become one Church.</hi> And now, good Reader, <hi>(utrum horum mavis, accipe)</hi> either follow me in a ſmooth and plain way, wherein no truth here foretold, and ſince accompliſht, or to be accompliſht, is croſt, or conceal'd. Or elſe follow Mr. <hi>Petrie,</hi> who leads thee athwart ſo many rubs and ſtumbling blocks. For firſt he gives thee a <hi>[therefore]</hi> without a <hi>[wherfore]</hi> a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the intimation of any tranſgreſſion. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he makes the Jews, that were to be given up: and She that travaileth in the time of their giving up, to be one people: which is ſo unlikely, that his comparing of this phraſe, with that which is ſpoken in the 4. Ch: v. 10. will not prove it. For although they be the words of the ſame Prophet, yet they are not in the ſame particular prophecy, and therefore not fit to interpret each other, unleſſe there were withall, ſome other circumſtance to confirm it.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113937:42"/>to the reſt) although then God ſhall ſhew his power in raiſing the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> as the firſt and chiefe cauſe, what hinders but that this alſo may uſe its owne endeavor to raiſe it ſelfe, as a ſecondary and leſſe principall cauſe? ſurely if God ſhall ſo raiſe it, that it ſhall doe nothing for it ſelfe, it may rather be ſaid, to be a ſpectator of its deliverance, then either an agent or a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. You ſay further <hi>[that none denieth it is included in the diſperſion of Iſrael]</hi> But yet you ſay withall, that the <hi>Jews</hi> diſperſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration here ſpoken of were both fulfill'd <hi>before their overthrow by the Romans,</hi> which the cloſe of this prophecy, ſhewing that after their reſtauration here foretold, they ſhould no more be diſperſt, doth deny. And theſe words alſo in the 11. <hi>ver. I will build it as in the daies of old,</hi> doe ſhew the contrary. For if you take, <hi>the daies of old,</hi> for the time immediately foregoing their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity; then I ſay, that ſo ſhort a time cannot be taken for the <hi>dayes of old;</hi> ſeeing it was but ſeventy yeares from that time; and conſequently it muſt imply a reſtauration after a captivity of a longer date. And if you take it for the daies of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> then I ſay, that it was not ſo reſtor'd after that captivity, for in the daies of theſe Kings, all the Tribes were but one Kingdom: and they were not tributaries to other Kings, but others to their Kings; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it is as yet thus to be reſtor'd. But that you may be ſure to avoide all that can be brought out of this prophecy for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſtauration of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> you will not have the 11. <hi>verſe</hi> to be meant of the reſtauration of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> and theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt not be taken for the <hi>Jewes,</hi> how plaine ſoever the text be for it, but for the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> for [<hi>ſo</hi> you ſay, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames expounds them, Acts</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.] Surely the Apoſtle repeates the 11. and 12. <hi>ver.</hi> of this chapter ſomewhat differently from the Prophets expreſſion, but yet ſpeakes not of Iſrael there at all. Neither doth he expound the <hi>building of David's Tabernacle, of the calling of the Gentiles,</hi> as you pretend. But ſhewes onely in the verſe following, that when it ſhall be built againe, the reſidue of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are yet uncald, ſhall then be cald; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Gentiles upon whom Gods Name is already cald, ſeeke after the Lord.</hi> And therefore you have not learned of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>James,</hi> to take <hi>the Tabernacle of David, for the beleeving Gentiles.</hi> Nor can I beleeve that the Hebrew Doctours doe ſo intepret it: albeit they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113937:42"/>may grant, that the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the time of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> as they expect him yet to come, is ſpoken of in the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> And doubtleſſe whoſoever ſhall looke into the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, he will ſay, that the actions here rehearſt may very well agree with men newly come out of captivity: but not that they doe any way intimate the calling of men to the Chriſtian faith. For what relation hath the <hi>building of waſte cities to inhabit them, the planting of vineyards to drinke the wine thereof, and the making of gardens to eate the fruit of them,</hi> to this? doubtleſſe none at all. For ſuppoſe that one ſhould tel you of a <hi>Jew</hi> that had lately built him a ſaire houſe; &amp; of an other that had planted an Orchard of choice fruit, would you thinke thereby, that they were become Chriſtians? nay would you not laugh at him, if he ſhould have no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? and yet without any ground for it, but your owne fancy as hath been ſhewed, you conclude <hi>[that by bodily houſes, and benefits, the Prophet underſtands ſpirituall.]</hi> To which you adjoyne Scripture to prove, that the elect cannot fall away; which is not queſtioned. And thus, good reader, thou haſt ſeene the firſt part of one and the ſame prophecy hiſtorically and properly underſtood; and the latter part allegorically and figuratively expounded; and that for no other reaſon but becauſe the deliverance of the <hi>Jewes</hi> out of their captivity here foretold hath not been as yet properly and literally fulfill'd, as their carrying into captivity hath been. And Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> will not take Gods word for it, that it ſhall be thus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fild. And therefore whereas I have askt, Who dares affirme that the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> here foretold, is meant of any other but their captivity by the <hi>Romans:</hi> ſeeing God hath ſaid here, that after their returne from this captivity they ſhall no more be pulled up out of their land? he tells thee that <hi>Zacharias</hi> hath not ſpared to affirme it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1 <hi>verſe</hi> 68. &amp;c. But is it not the ſame God, that ſpake by the mouth of both theſe Prophets? a God that is not as man, that he ſhould lie, or forget himſelfe.

                     <p n="1">1. That the Prophet ſpeakes not of any whom the Spirit ſhould endue with the gift of tongues, is ſo evident, that you could not deny it; and yet you dare ſay, <hi>[If this exception were true, it would prove, that the Apoſtle citeth the words impertinently.]</hi> Belike then the Apoſtle muſt be out in citing them, rather then you in ſhewing to what end he cited them. No, Sir, the Apoſtle alledgeth it very pretinently, in that he ſhewes by it, that the diſciples ſpake not thus out of drunkenneſſe, as ſome accuſed them, (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from an evil ſpirit) but by reaſon of the effuſion of that Spirit on them, of which <hi>Joel</hi> had ſpoken. And therefore the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take is in you, who doe very impertinently conclude from hence; that the ſame effuſion of the Spirit, which <hi>Joel</hi> ſpake of was then fulfilled. For although the ſame Spirit may be powred out divers times, yet that powring out of it which <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeakes of, can be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled but once: &amp; conſequently, not at our Saviour's firſt comming, and ſecond comming too. And now who fights moſt againſt the Apoſtle, &amp; the Spirit of God, he that underſtands them rightly, and endeavours to make others do ſo too; or he that miſunderſtanding them himſelfe, had rather condemne them both, and draw all others into an error with him, then yeeld to the truth? and here I would intreat thee, reader, to take notice, that when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Petrie</hi> hath little or nothing to ſay, he commonly breaks out into the more violent ſpeech, thereby to diſgrace what he cannot anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This part of your anſwer, is as much to the matter as the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For whereas I ſpeake of the gift of tongues, as the moſt remarkeable effect of the Spirit in the Apoſtles: you ſpeake of the manner of the Spirits deſcending upon them, as the moſt remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able worke of the Spirit. But doe you know what you ſay? was it not a greater worke to make the Apoſtles ſpeake divers languages, then to cauſe the ſound of a mighty winde, or the appearance of tongues, which were onely outward ſignes of the extraordinary gift, which the Spirit then wrought within them? I can hardly thinke, that any man but you will ſay otherwiſe. And by your leave, it was the Apoſtles ſpeaking with other tongues, which made the Multitude come together, and at which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as the 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c. doe ſhew. And not the ſound of the ruſhing winde, that filled the houſe where the Apoſtles were
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113937:46"/>ſitting, when the appearance of cloven tongues, like as of fire, came and ſate upon each of them. For this was paſt: and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes not of it, but ſhewes onely, that their ſpeaking thus in divers languages, was the worke of the ſame Spirit, of which <hi>Joel</hi> had ſpoken. And your concluſion <hi>[therefore Peter citeth the words pertinently]</hi> (which I dare ſay, none is ſo likely to doubt of, as your ſelfe) hangs as looſely to your premiſes, as the premiſes doe to that which I have ſaid.</p>

But to ſay that one of theſe things ſhall be accompliſht in one age, and another in the next, or ſome hundreds of yeares after, and ſo of the reſt, is to make the word of God of none effect. For <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeakes of theſe things as immediately to enſue, if not to contemporate with each other: and ſpeake but of one powring out of the Spirit; and that alſo to be a forerunner of the Day of Chriſt's ſecond comming: and therefore it can be but once fulfilled, and that onely in its proper ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But you will make good all that you have ſaid by and by. For the Day of our Saviour's firſt comming [<hi>was terrible,</hi> you ſay.

For ſhame then recall this doctrine, and thinke not to make any one beleeve, that the ſicke perſon will be afraid to heare of his health, or the condemned priſoner of his pardon; and til you can doe this, perſwade not your ſelfe, that you can prove our Saviour's preſence terrible in the Day of his humiliation, wherein <hi>he was approved for ſo many ſignes, miracles, and wonders,</hi> wrought onely to make men lay hold on the meanes of their eternall happines. And if the hiſtory of theſe things be ſo wonderfully pleaſant unto us, what was the performance to ſuch as ſaw them, and the benefit of the miracles to ſuch as felt the vertue of them? You goe on, and ſay [<hi>that the time of Chriſt's ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhall be more terrible then his firſt was.</hi> And ſurely the great deſtroyers of the earth ſhould elſe have greateſt cauſe to climbe up to the tops of the mountaines to meet him firſt, (if ſuch a thing might be) as rayling <hi>Shimei</hi> was the firſt of al the houſe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> that met King <hi>David</hi> in his returne after <hi>Abſoloms</hi> conſpiracy; and no need at all, to call for the mountains to hide them from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

                     <p n="1">1. My words doe ſhew, that this prophecy of <hi>Joel,</hi> cannot be meant of the time of Chriſt's Judging the dead (when they ſhall be all called out of their graves) as it is commonly expounded; and that becauſe it ſpeakes of the gathering together of a great Army againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> but not after Chriſt's comming (which opinion you falſely attribute to me) although againſt his comming, as the parallel prophecy <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. at the 12, 13, 14. <hi>ver.</hi> doth ſhew, for that Army is to be gathered into <hi>Armageddon</hi> in the time of the ſixth <hi>vial,</hi> and to be deſtroy'd at the powring out of the ſeventh <hi>vial,</hi> by our Saviour and his Heavenly Hoſt, as the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> and the latter part of the 19. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> the 11. &amp;c. doe plainly declare.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That which you here begin with was the ground of the former part of your anſwer, but on what ground I know not; for I deny that this prophecy doth ſpeake of a battle after Chriſt's comming, albeit I doe affirme, that our Saviour's comming ſhall be when this great Army is gathered together againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> as ready to deſtroy them. And your ſhewing the coherence of this chapter with the precedent, doth make more againſt you then you are aware of, for it is remarkeable, that you rightly conclude from hence, <hi>[that the Prophet ſhewes the contents which I have urged out of both (being in the Hebrew all in one chapter) to be at the ſame time.]</hi> And yet you ſay preſently after [<hi>that this ſame time is not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular yeare or age, but comprehends all the time from the</hi> Jews <hi>returne from</hi> Babylon <hi>to the ſecond comming of Chriſt</hi>] which is as if you had ſaid, This particular time, is not a particular time, but many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular times; yea thouſands of particular times. This ſame time, is not the ſame time, but more then the ſame time: yea as much more then the ſame time, as is from <hi>the Jews returne from Babylon</hi> to this ſame time.

So that it is as if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>In thoſe ſelfe ſame dayes, and in that very time, in which I ſhall bring againe the captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem, I will alſo gather all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. And beſides, how I pray can the ſignes, that are to be ſhewed more often then any man knows: or in any part of ſo large a time as you ſpeake of (all which your expoſition grants) foreſhew the neerneſſe of the terrible Day of the Lord? which yet is the onely end of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that <hi>Joel</hi> ſaith ſhall be ſhewed, <hi>in the Heavens and in the earth at that time.</hi> For our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. ſpeaks of the ſame darkening of the Sun and Moone that the Prophet doth: and if his word may be taken, theſe ſignes ſhall as infallibly ſhew the neere approach of his ſecond comming, as the ſhooting forth of the leaves of the figgtree doth ſhew that the ſummer is nigh at hand.

And therefore the ſenſe which you by this means
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113937:49"/>would thruſt upon the prophet muſt needs be your owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and not the Prophet's. For the Prophet ſpeakes here but of one Army, and the parallel prophecy <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. ſpeakes but of one Army, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> who foreſhewes the ſame battle, ſpeakes but of one Army, and they all ſay that the <hi>Iews</hi> onely are to be oppoſed by this Army, and that a ſudden deſtruction ſhall come on this Army; and conſequently the deliverance here ſpoken of, is to be ſhort and ſudden, and the people to be delivered by it, are the <hi>Jews:</hi> And ſo here is nothing at all touching God's ſpecial prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Church in all ages, or of many deliverances, but here is an extraordinary Judgement foreſhewing the dreadfull over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and downefall of all the enemies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the then faithfull Chriſtians. And as concerning the place where this Army is to be gathered together, this is chiefely to be taken notice of, that the prophecy ſpeaking but of one Army, it can be meant but of one place, and that to be in the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> whither the Nations ſhall come up againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhortly upon their returne, as the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> here doth intimate, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> doth plainly declare. Neither is the doubt you bring, about the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſo many Nations meeting together in one place, of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; For it is not uſuall for a people wholly to leave their owne countrey when they invade their enemies land (for that were the ready way to loſe their owne land and to ſtarve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) but to ſend forth ſuch a ſtrength, as they may well raiſe and maintaine, and the Prophet here calls for their men of war, and their mighty men; but not for all the men of theſe Nations, much leſſe for all the people of theſe Nations: and who knows not, that many hundred thouſands may againſt the time of a battle be drawne together within the ſpace of a few miles? and at once to overthrow ſo mighty an Army as the Prophets ſpeake of, and thereupon to make all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For [<hi>if theſe prophecies,</hi> ſay you, <hi>be expounded of beleevers, whether Jews or Gentiles, then none of theſe abſurdities ſhall follow which are here rebearſt</hi>] and ſo you take them in this figurative ſenſe without any other warrant for it, but your (<hi>ſic vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And martyrdom is victory;</hi> and next, <hi>that albeit the Church were oftner crown'd with martyrdom then victory, yet ſhe hath been crown'd with glorious victory.</hi>] So that as before by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> you underſtood the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to avoyd the force of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo here for the like end, you would willingly put a figurative ſenſe too upon the victory mentioned in the prophecies: but it may not be; for theſe prophecies doe not foreſhew the death and affliction of God's people by their enemies (as it is in perſecution and martyrdom) but their great deliverance, and their enemies wonderfull deſtruction. Yea ſuch a deſtruction as never yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the enemies of God's Church, either <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or Chriſtian. And therefore as your ſpiritual conquering is very impertinently inferr'd, ſo no glorious outward &amp; bodily victory that the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hath had, will match with this that the Prophets ſpeake of, nor indeed all that ſhe hath had. To my next reaſons which ſhew that theſe prophecies of <hi>Zecha.</hi> were not fulfilled in the times of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as <hi>Cornelious a Lapide</hi> expounds them, you ſay nothing: but huddle them up together with that which you have ſaid touching the Church of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For [<hi>the houſe of David,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is exalted in the perſon of Chriſt and his members; and all the wealth of the Nations hath been employed, or ſhall be employed for the uſe of the faithfull (albeit not in any particular yeare or age) and the Lord ſhall deſcend and all the Saints ſhall be with him.</hi>] But by the houſe of <hi>David</hi> is meant the linage of <hi>David</hi> that are in captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as by its being oppoſed to the tents of <hi>Judah</hi> it is manifeſt:) and as the faithfull <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not of the linage of <hi>David,</hi> ſo though Chriſt be deſcended of <hi>David</hi> as touching his humane nature;

                     <p n="1">1. Surely your further clearing is no other then a further clouding, as the very reading of this prophecy, and that which our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and 16. is of it ſelfe ſufficient to diſcover. For <hi>Ezek.</hi> ſpeaks of uniting the <hi>Jews</hi> together under one King in their owne land, and our Saviour ſpeaks of uniting the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> into one Church, after a certaine number of elect <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be cald. <hi>Other ſheepe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have which are not of this fold,</hi> (that is, other elect ſervants which are not of this Nation) <hi>them alſo I muſt bring, and there ſhall be one fold and one Shepherd.</hi> Where it is to be noted by the words <hi>[them alſo I muſt bring]</hi> that he ſpeaks onely of ſuch elect <hi>Gentiles</hi> as were to be cald before the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould make one ſheepfold, and not after they were one ſheepfold. For when they are all brought, then it is, that there ſhall be one ſheepfold, and not while they are bringing. No, the words of our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. at the 43. <hi>ver.</hi> will not admit of ſuch a meaning, for <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.</hi> Whereby it is evident, that the <hi>[Other ſheepe]</hi> he ſpeaks of in the 10 chap. of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſhould be brought to the faith, when the Nation of the Iewes ſhould be deprived of the meanes of ſalvation: and conſequently when it could not poſſibly be one Church. And therefore in ſaying that the Iewes and Gentiles are at this time one ſheepfold, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our Saviour, and affirme that the Iewes are now ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ordinary meanes of ſalvation: For this they have not, but ſhall have it when the time comes, in which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:113937:57"/>ſhall be one ſheepfold. And then alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom agane in their owne land, and Chriſt ſhall reigne over both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> together. And thus our Saviour's words doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expound <hi>Ezek.</hi> prophecy, nor ſhew that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now one ſheepfold. But rather point out the time when <hi>Ezek.</hi> prophecy ſhal be fulfilled, to wit, when the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhal be one fold under one Shepheard. So much have you miſt your aime in alledging theſe propheticall words of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The words, <hi>David,</hi> King and Shepheard, will no more prove that the temporal prophecies (or temporal part of the prophecies) in which they are uſed, are to be ſpiritually and figuratively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, then Gods words to <hi>David, Thou ſhalt feed my people Iſrael</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. will prove, that <hi>David's</hi> Kingdom was not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom; nor he a temporal King. Or then <hi>David's</hi> owne words of his people, <hi>But theſe ſheep what have they done?</hi> will prove that the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Jews</hi> were all faithfull perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Being conſcious, that all which you have ſaid before, to make men take theſe prophecies in a myſticall ſenſe will nought availe you, if the word [land] in the prophecies ſhould be properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> you now endeavor to perſwade them to take this figuratively alſo, and your firſt reaſon to induce them to it, is (like to that by which <hi>Jereboam</hi> diſſuaded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>) <hi>becauſe</hi> [<hi>it may be more eaſily underſtood,</hi> you ſay, <hi>in the ſpiritual then an earthly ſenſe</hi>] But what is that ſpiritual ſenſe which may ſo eaſily be underſtood, and yet was ſo hard to be deſcribed, that you could not tell us what it was. But ſure I am, that God hath told us by the Prophet what land he minds to joyne the Tribes together in; <hi>even in their owne land, ver.</hi> 21. <hi>in the land upon the mountaines of Iſrael, ver.</hi> 22. <hi>in the land that he gave unto Jacob his ſervant, ver</hi> 25. which circumſtances doe infallibly manifeſt, that it can be meant of no other land or place but <hi>Judea.</hi> And therefore the ſecond reaſon you bring to ſhew, that it is beſt to take the word [land] ſpiritually, is both falſe and impious. For [<hi>that land,</hi> you ſay, <hi>was not given to Jacob.</hi>] No? did not God ſay to <hi>Jacob</hi> in a dreame; <hi>The land whereon thou lieſt to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 28.13. and hath he not ſaid here in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>the land that I gave unto Jacob my ſervant?</hi> no marvel th n that you can ſo lightly reject all the plaine texts of Scripture that

                        </hi> in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. expounds the 27. <hi>verſe</hi> of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of the <hi>Corinthians [as a part of the People the Prophet here ſpeaks of]</hi> it is not ſo, for as the words which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of, are rather taken out of the 26, of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> at the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> where they are more fully delivered, then out of this Prophecie: ſo they are not alledg'd by the Apoſtle to make the <hi>Corinthians</hi> thinke, that they were part of the people ſpoken of in thoſe places, where any of the words, that the Apoſtle quotes, are us'd, (which is evidently falſe) but to ſhew that the Faithfull (whether <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi>) had all the ſame ſpiritual fellowſhip with God, &amp; therefore ſhould have the like care not to defile their bodies, which are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God; with the unfruitfull works of darkneſſe, of which he gives a particular inſtance to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> touching the conſorting with unbelievers and Infidels, in their Feaſts and rites celebrated in honour of their Idols, and that theſe words were onely thus applyed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Cor.</hi> the very next <hi>verſe</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> doth declare, wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are oppos'd to all other Nations; ſo farre were other Nations from being included in the Prophecie as a part of them. And therefore this proofe is too weak alſo to ſupport your concluſion <hi>[that the Jewes and Gentiles, who were ſtrangely divided, are now one Church by Faith in Chriſt]</hi> yea doubtleſſe they were never divided with greater hatred one againſt the other, then they have been ſince the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and our Saviour hath told us, that the meanes of ſalvation was to be taken from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that a part of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (even
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113937:58"/>the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that have been a long time the Church of God) might be ſaved by it; before it ſhould be given to them againe, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. ſaith alſo, <hi>that wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> And can yet all the ſpirituall and temporall Prophecies which concerne them, be at the ſame time (the time of their unbeliefe, and of Gods wrath againſt them) fulfilled in them? theſe are groſſe contradictions, and 'tis not the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a few <hi>Jewes</hi> in many ages, or of all that have hitherto been cal'd by the Goſpel, that will ſolve the doubt, for the Prophets ſpeake of a Nationall converſion and deliverance. And beſides you your ſelfe doe tell us <hi>[that through many ages Ephraimites are not knowne in any part of the Earth]</hi> and how then can they help make one Church with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as you ſay) if there are now no ſuch people on the earth? can there be a union betwixt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and nothing? But this ſlam was brought in as a reaſon wherefore <hi>the people of Iſrael and Ephraim ſhould be expounded typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally for the Gentiles.</hi> And if there were no <hi>Jewes</hi> left; yet why ſhould theſe Prophecies be the rather expounded of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for that? were it not better to ſay, that they were conditionall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and ſhould have been fulfil'd if the <hi>Jewes</hi> had been obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Gods word, then without any neceſſitie to make them types of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſalvation? And yet we doe not grant, that there are no <hi>Ephraimites</hi> now, although none are cal'd ſo; for none of the <hi>Jewes</hi> are now cal'd after the names of their particular Tribes, at leaſt by the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and why ſhould that Tribe rather then the reſt? or why ſhould this prove that Tribe to be conſum'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the reſt? doubtleſſe it's ſufficient to prove them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the twelve Tribes are remaining: and they were remaining in the Apoſtles dayes, as St. <hi>James, c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp; St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 26 <hi>v.</hi> 7. doe witneſſe, and St. <hi>Joh.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113937:59"/>Kingdomes, and how could you tell us here, <hi>that through many ages Ephraimites are not knowne in any part of the earth,</hi> when as you ſay but a little before, page 18. <hi>that all malice betwixt the Tribes, and betwixt them and the Gentiles ſhould be at an end under Chriſt?</hi> For if this bealreadie fulfill'd (as you teach) what ſhould conſume the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> after all malice betwixt them and all others was departed? and if it be not yet fulfill'd (as indeed it is not) you muſt either recall what you before affirme ſhould be done under Chriſt, or elſe confeſſe, that the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> muſt needs remaine to the accompliſhment of it. Now as for the Prophecie of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> it is to be underſtood of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as well as this of <hi>Ezek.</hi> and the word <hi>Jezreel,</hi> which ſignifies the ſeed of God, will help you nothing.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113937:60"/>the word <hi>[Jew]</hi> is taken indifinitely for any <hi>Jew.</hi> And wherefore is it that you urge theſe words of the Apoſtle? doe you think that it proves the name <hi>[Jew]</hi> to be indifferently taken for a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile?</hi> ſurely theſe words ſhew, that the beleeving <hi>Gentile</hi> is as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Lord as the beleeving <hi>Jew:</hi> and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Jew</hi> which can move God to beſtow grace on him, rather then on the <hi>Gentile,</hi> as the following words confirme: but they ſhew not that God takes a faithfull <hi>Jew</hi> for a faithfull <hi>Greeke,</hi> nor a faithfull <hi>Greeke</hi> for a faithfull <hi>Jew.</hi> And therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude from hence [that albeit the prophet was ſent perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet his words were no leſſe true and meaned of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>] for though through Chriſt all beleevers are the people of God, yet through Chriſt a beleever of one Nation, is not made a beleever of another Nation: &amp; though every one that (confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) <hi>cals upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> yet every one that cals on the name of the Lord ſhall not thereby become a <hi>Jew.</hi> And how can you take <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are of different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them; and yet will not take <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for <hi>Jews,</hi> which is a Name belonging equally to all the Tribes?

Now the firſt part of the dilemma is falſe: for if that Prophecie be meant of the ten Tribes, as they abode many dayes without a King &amp;c. ſo, who dare deny, that they did returne, and ſeeke the Lord their God and Chriſt their King? when the Goſpel was preached to the ſcattered ſtrangers not onely through</hi> Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, 1 Pet. 1.1. <hi>but likewiſe to</hi> Syria, Aſſyria, &amp;c. <hi>and expreſſely to the twelve Tribes ſcattered abroad,</hi> Jam. 1.1. <hi>who can hold the negative, that the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did never returne and ſeeke Chriſt? and the other part is no leſſe faulty: for Chriſt came not till the Scepter was departed from</hi> Judah: <hi>and theſe words, the latter dayes, are not to be referred unto the</hi> 4. verſe, (<hi>as if the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>ſhould abide many dayes without a King, and ſacrifice in the latter dayes, and then returne</hi>) <hi>but unto the fift</hi> ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p n="1">1. That by <hi>David</hi> here Chriſt is meant, is not to be doubted,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113937:63"/>but that therefore this Prophecie was fulfill'd at Chriſts incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is to be proved, and ſo it is too, that the Rhetoricall and tropicall ſenſe of ſome words and phraſes in a Prophecie, doth faſten a myſticall meaning upon it; for the ſenſe of a Prophecie takes not its denomination from the words in which it is ſpoken, but from the things it ſpeakes of, if it ſpeakes of materiall things (whether in a proper or figurative ſtraine) it is a materiall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie; if of ſpirituall things (whether in a proper or figurative ſtraine) it is a ſpirituall Prophecie, if of both, it's partly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and partly ſpirituall, and the title of a Prophecie takes its denomination, from the place, perſon, or people of which it is ſpoken.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a great difference betwixt the <hi>laſt dayes, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes.</hi> For the <hi>(laſt dayes) Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and the <hi>(laſt times)</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. doe comprehend the whole time under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the time I ſay, from Chriſts firſt comming to his ſecond: but the <hi>[latter times]</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. doe ſignifie onely the latter part of the laſt times. And as the laſt times, or dayes, have their latter times; ſo againe the <hi>[latter times]</hi> have their <hi>[laſt dayes]</hi> as we may ſee in the 2 <hi>Tim. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and in the 2 <hi>Pet. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and of the end of theſe <hi>[laſt dayes]</hi> of the <hi>[latter times]</hi> are the <hi>[latter dayes]</hi> in this Prophecie to be underſtood; as St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words in the 11. <hi>chap.</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> at the 25. and 26. <hi>verſes</hi> doe evidence. For <hi>I would not Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, that you ſhould be ignorant of this <hi>myſtery, that blindneſſe in part is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Iſrael, untill the fulneſſe of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in, and ſo all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> And yet it is enough to confirme the firſt part of the <hi>Dilemma;</hi> that the <hi>[latter dayes]</hi> in this Prophecie, cannot be taken for the firſt dayes of the preaching of the Goſpel, in which onely the Goſpel was preacht unto the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſought the Lord in thoſe firſt dayes of the Goſpel, cannot be the ſame <hi>Iſraelites</hi> which the Prophet ſaith ſhall ſeeke the Lord in the latter dayes of the Goſpel, that is, not long before Chriſts appearing. And baſides, what effect the word of God tooke amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> even in the dayes in which it was preach't unto them, we have formerly ſhewed out of the 13. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> at the 45. and 46. <hi>verſes,</hi> and out of the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. at the 15. and 16. <hi>ver.</hi> to which wee may adde the ſame
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113937:63"/>Apoſtles great heavineſſe and continuall ſorrow for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3. and his words concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in 31, 32, and 33. <hi>ver.</hi> of the fame chapter, and his prayer for them, and record of them, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and his words, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10.12.15.25. and 28. in which places he ſaith, <hi>that they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone</hi> (that is, at Chriſt preacht unto them) <hi>that they ſubmitted not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the righteouſneſſe of God: that they were enemies to the Goſpel, and that God had given them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and eares that they ſhould not heare,</hi> and therefore we dare not but to affirme that <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not then returne thus the Lord; to wit, by repentance and embracement of the Goſpel. For the Prophet ſpeakes not of the returne of ſome particular Families, or of ſome particular perſons of divers Families; but of all the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were to be ſo long without a King, that is, of the whole body of the ten Tribes at leaſt. And of the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God it is (that is, of all the Tribes, though not of all of every Tribe) that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the foreſaid Texts of Scripture, and how then can it be ſaid of any of the Tribes, that they have as yet ſought the Lord? and if none of the Tribes are converted, where is the union you boaſt of betwixt the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles?</hi> How are they one Chriſtian Church, when as not one of the Tribes hath been hitherto joyn'd to this Church? And further though it be not ſaid expreſſely here, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall returne into their Land, yet other parallel Prophecies doe ſhew, that the word <hi>(returne)</hi> doth imply this: and ſo doe ſome of the contents of this Prophecie. For whereas it is ſaid <hi>(they ſhall be many dayes without a King)</hi> it is to be underſtood, that after the end of theſe dayes, they ſhall againe have a King; to wit, one to reigne over them in a temporall Monarchy, as before they had, when <hi>David</hi> did reigne over them: for ſuch a King it is that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>they ſhall be without,</hi> and he ſaith not, that they ſhall be without him alwayes, but <hi>many dayes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the expiring of theſe dayes, they ſhall againe enjoy ſuch a King: and conſequently they ſhall againe become a Kingdome on Earth too. As for the other part of the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to ſay to it, and therefore you fight with your owne fancies onely; firſt in ſaying <hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113937:64"/>I have neither affirmed, nor denyed, but onely urg'd the Prophecie of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſhew that the Scepter could not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> till Chriſts comming (for whether it was to depart immediately before, or ſhortly after, it is not materiall in this Argument) and conſequently, that if this Prophecie were to be underſtood of the two Tribes, the puniſhment in <hi>abiding many dayes without a King, and without a ſacrifice, &amp;c.</hi> could not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd on them, till their Captivitie under the <hi>Romans,</hi> at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their City: from whence alſo it will follow, that their returne here foretold muſt needs be as yet to come. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſaying, that the latter dayes are not to be refer'd unto the 4. <hi>v.</hi> (as if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould abide many dayes without a King and ſacrifice in the latter dayes, and then returne) but unto the 5. <hi>v.</hi> in the end whereof they are.) For I never thought that the <hi>(latter dayes)</hi> did comprehend the <hi>(many dayes)</hi> ſpoken of in the 4. <hi>v.</hi> but I know that they doe ſhew what a long continuance and ſpace of time the <hi>(many dayes)</hi> doe imply, for 'tis not before but afterward, that is, at the end of the <hi>(many dayes)</hi> that the <hi>(latter dayes)</hi> doe begin; in which the contents of the latter part of the Prophecie are to be fulfill'd: as the contents of the firſt part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie are in the <hi>(many dayes.)</hi> And as I have already prov'd, theſe <hi>(latter dayes)</hi> not to be begun: ſo you your ſelfe ſeeme to confeſſe as much, ſaying, (<hi>and ſo in the latter dayes they ſhall returne, and ſeeke the Lord their God, and Chriſt their King, as they did,</hi> Acts 2.41. <hi>and</hi> chap. 4.4.] but whereas you adde, <hi>[and in ſeverall ages]</hi> ſurely the converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did even wholly weare away in a very ſhort time after the preaching of the Goſpel. For they were St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> that told them: <hi>It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken unto you, but ſeeing yee put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, loe, we turne to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 46. and that their behaviour was the ſame towards the Apoſtles in other places, as well as at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> you may ſee, in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> at the 14, 15, and 16. <hi>verſes.</hi> And therefore their converſion held not one ago, ſo ſhort was the continuance of the <hi>Jewes</hi> joyning with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Chriſtian Faith, yea too ſhort and too ſmall to prove, that the uniting of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And in the 36. <hi>chap.</hi> at the 8. <hi>ver.</hi> this prophecy is made to the Mountaines of <hi>Iſrael.

Now as none of the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies will beare the title of conditional prophecies, ſo neither will this; for the land it ſelfe could neither doe any thing, for which God ſhould make ſuch a promiſe unto it, nor for which he ſhould refuſe to fulfill unto it, what he hath promiſed. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that he who will deny, that theſe prophecies are to be underſtood of the proſperity and happineſſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> onely: that will deny I ſay, that they are properly and hiſtorically to be taken; or that they are as yet to be fulfilled, will not ſticke to ſay any thing.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. You deny that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> alledgeth the Prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> for ſuch a converſion of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> for he ſpeakes expreſly (you ſay) of viſiting the <hi>Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> by your owne confeſſion alledgeth two Prophecies, one (as you ſay after <hi>page</hi> 27.) of old <hi>Simeon, Acts</hi> 15. at the 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> and the other of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, ver.</hi> 16.17. where there is expreſſe mention of building the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>David</hi> (as in the former there is, of viſiting the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) and yet you would have this laſt Prophecy to be no more then an
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113937:69"/>Expoſition of the former (which we have once already ſhew'd to be falſe) and were it not to expound <hi>Notum per ignotius,</hi> to make the Comment more obſcure then the Text, to ſay that by <hi>[the building of the Tabernacle of David] James</hi> meant the <hi>[viſiting of the Gentiles]</hi> before ſpoken of? Thus then whatſoever talke you make of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent converſion, and union of the <hi>Jewes</hi> with the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet when you come to apply the Scriptures, you debarre them of all intereſt in thoſe Prophecies, or that part of a Prophecy which concernes them alone, ſo much doe you favour their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or eſteeme their company. But as you hold the words in the 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> to have reference to <hi>Simeons</hi> Prophecy, ſo you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>Simcon</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>that he ſhould be a light to lighten the Gentles;</hi> before he ſaith of him, that he ſhould be the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and what doth this imply, but that a ſubſtituted part of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were to become the Church of Chriſt, before the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould receive the Goſpel? for being indued with the ſpirit of Prophecy, he could not ſpeake at randome; and therefore the very order of theſe words is obſerveable; with which Saint <hi>James</hi> his changing of the firſt words of the Prophecy <hi>[In that they]</hi> into <hi>[After this]</hi> doth very well agree; which might elſe as well (if not better) have beene alledg'd according to the Prophets expreſſion, had this Prophecy beene no more but a larger explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and further confirmation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> calling. And if you looke into the latter part of <hi>Amos</hi> Prophecy recorded by St. <hi>James,</hi> you may ſee, that at the building againe of <hi>Davids</hi> Tabernacle, there is not onely mention of <hi>[the reſidue of men]</hi> that ſhould then ſeeke after God, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, upon whom God's Name is call'd, before that (for why elſe ſhould they be thus diſtinguiſhed from other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are then to ſeeke the Lord as well as they?) And what will follow from hence upon your expounding <hi>[the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Tabernacle of</hi> David] of the firſt calling of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely this will follow, that the firſt calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was not the firſt calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſeeing [<hi>the people upon whom God's name</hi> all <hi>is call'd</hi>] is alwayes meant of a people that doth worſhip the true <hi>God.</hi> And conſequently from the words [<hi>after this I will return &amp; wil build again the Tabernacle of</hi> David] inferr'd upon the foreſaid <hi>[vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting of the Gentiles]</hi> in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> and from the words [<hi>that the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of men might ſeeke after the Lord, and all the</hi> Gentiles <hi>upon whom my
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113937:69"/>Name is call'd</hi>] referr'd to the time when it is againe to be built, it muſt needs follow, that here is an expreſſe mention, as well of the Nationall converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> after the viſiting of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as of the calling of a ſubſtituted part of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before ſuch a converſion of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> for as the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> cannot poſſibly ſignifie the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo the building againe of it, cannot be meant of God's receiving thoſe Nations for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which were never before his people. And thus this Prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> ſhewes not the calling of the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, nor the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely, but the order of both; for which purpoſe it was alledged by the Apoſtle, to wit, to ſhew, that a ſubſtituted part of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be called, before the generall converſion of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and that all <hi>Gentiles</hi> whatſoever, that were then left both of the call'd and uncall'd, ſhould make one Church with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> was againe built, that is, upon the converſion, deliverance, and ſetling of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their own land, according as the foreſaid Prophecies doe declare. And whereas you ſeeme to deny, that this Prophecy was taken out of <hi>Amos</hi> onely [<hi>becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes not onely of</hi> Amos, <hi>but ſaith generally, to this agree the words of the Prophets,</hi>] you ſhew great weakeneſſe in it, for (beſides that it is an uſuall manner of ſpeaking, to put the plurall number for the ſingular, and the ſingular for the plurall,) he might very well ſay, to this agree <hi>the words of the Prophets,</hi> becauſe other Prophets alſo foretell the ſame thing, although he brought an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance onely out of one of them: for I am ſure that this prophecy is wholly in <hi>Amos,</hi> with a little difference from this tranſlation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the originall, but none according to the Septuagint, as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Mayer</hi> affirmeth. And why doe you ſay before <hi>[Iames alledgeth the prophecy of Amos,]</hi> if you did not thinke it to be the prophecy of <hi>Amos?</hi> and if you knew that but a part of it was his, why did you not ſhew what words were ſpoken by him, and what words by ſome other Prophets? But you could not: for <hi>[to this agree the words of the Prophets,]</hi> is indeede as if he had ſaid, to this agree the words of <hi>Amos</hi> in the booke of the Prophets. For the <hi>minor</hi> (or leſſer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, were all in one volume, called the booke of the Prophets, and therefore when a teſtimony is brought out of any of them, it is moſt commonly alledged as from the whole booke, and not from that prophecy where they are written in the booke. And thus you may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113937:70"/>read, [<hi>As it is written in the booke of the Prophets, Acts</hi> 7.42.] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>as it is written by Amos in the booke of the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 13.40. <hi>[which is ſpoken of in the Prophets]</hi> that is, by <hi>Habbakkuk in the booke of the Prophets.</hi> And in all this I hope I have fully anſwered this great doubt, the mentioning whereof doth either ſhew your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſight in Divinity, if you were not able to ſatisfie your ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: or your great delight to wrangle, if you knew the anſwer to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>You deny that the Apoſtle Paul alledgeth the prophecy of Iſaiah to ſhew the generall converſion of the Jewes, after the converſion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Gentiles: for he ſaith not,</hi> (you ſay) <hi>and then all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, but, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But though he ſaith not <hi>[and then,]</hi> yet <hi>Paraeus</hi> tels you, that this, and more then this is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: for he ſaith there is an <hi>[Ellipſis]</hi> of the antecedent; a defect or leaving out of ſomething that ſhould have been ſpoken before. So that the full rehearſing of the Apoſtles minde herein had been thus. <hi>For I would not brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſtery: that blindeneſſe is in part happened to Iſrael, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in: and then when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in, the blindneſſe ſhall ceaſe, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And doubtleſſe this is the true meaning of what the Apoſtle hath more briefely uttered. And yet we doe not grant, <hi>[that the Apoſtle ſhewes no order and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in time,]</hi> becauſe he ſaith not <hi>[and then]</hi> but <hi>[and ſo.]</hi> For the diſtance of time betwixt <hi>Iſrael's</hi> caſting off, and calling againe, is expreſt by the words <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in:]</hi> without which or the like words in the premiſes, the word <hi>[then]</hi> in the concluſion had beene of little force: as the want of it after ſuch a plaine marke and boundary of <hi>Iſraels</hi> blindneſſe, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; for ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>blindneſſe is in part hapned to Iſrael, untill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in,</hi> and adds preſently after, <hi>and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and confirmes it too with a Prophecy which concernes the pardoning and purifying of the <hi>Jewes onely;</hi> who that calls his wits about him, can beleeve, that the Apoſtle meant nevertheleſſe, that blindneſſe ſhould never depart from that Nation? which doome your expounding of <hi>[all Iſrael] of none but of the called of Iſrael and of the Gentiles,</hi> doth neceſſarily put upon it. For by the words <hi>[and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved]</hi> you doe not underſtand a further calling of any, but the accompliſhment of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113937:70"/>the whole number of the beleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> formerly call'd: and therefore the blindneſſe being to continue, <hi>untill the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in,</hi> and then (according to your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the calling of men to ſalvation, to ceaſe; it muſt needs follow, that in your ſenſe, there is to be no other end of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> blindneſſe, then the eternall condemnation and perdition of almoſt that whole Nation. Whoſe generall converſion, many of the Fathers, and the moſt and moſt learned men amongſt Proteſtants and Papiſts doe acknowledge to be both plainely foretold here by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted by the Prophecy alledg'd out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which you grant to be the ſame in ſenſe with the Prophecies before recited, and yet the want of this poore particle <hi>[then]</hi> muſt ſway the ſcales on your ſide, againſt ſo many evident authorities of God and man. And ſeeing you prize your conceit ſo highly, you might very well have afforded us a paraphraſe of the 25. and 26. <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> that ſo we might have knowne your meaning fully, and ſeene how you could make all St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words here ſuite with that myſticall ſenſe which you take <hi>Iſrael</hi> in.

For the preceding words are, <hi>that blindneſſe is in part hapned to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>untill the fulneſſe of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall come in;</hi> and the meaning of them (you ſay) is, <hi>All</hi> Iſrael <hi>are the called of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and of the</hi> Gentiles; and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, <hi>and ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and the meaning of this alſo (you ſay) is, <hi>All</hi> Iſrael <hi>are the called of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and of the</hi> Gentiles.

And laſtly, it is not true, that <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> here is more then <hi>[Iſrael]</hi> here, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to whom blindneſſe is hapned in part, comprehends both the beleeving and unbeleeving <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and conſequently all <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and although <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> be more then the blinded, or not blinded part of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, then <hi>Iſrael</hi> diviſively taken, yet it is not more then <hi>Iſrael</hi> indiviſively taken, then <hi>Iſrael</hi> to whom blindneſſe is hapned in part, and in part not hapned: for thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the 25. <hi>v.</hi> is <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> too, becauſe it contains all beleevers &amp; unbeleevers of the <hi>Jews</hi> together; although it be not <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> as it is appli'd to the beleeving or unbeleeving <hi>Jews</hi> ſeverally, and apart; and therfore in ſaying, that <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> is more then <hi>[Iſrael to whom blindnes is hapned in part]</hi> you do ſay; that <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi> is more then <hi>all Iſrael:</hi> &amp; though it be more then the beleeving or unbeleeving part of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet to argue thus from hence, <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> is more then the blinded part of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> therefore it comprehends the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both: is juſt ſuch an argument as this, all <hi>England</hi> is more then almoſt all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> therefore it is <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> too; or, all your wit is more then the greateſt part of your wit, therefore it is your wit and your folly both. And whereas you ſay <hi>[that in this ſignification the proofe following in the cited teſtimony muſt neceſſarily be underſtood]</hi> you doe hereby cloſely endeavour to put the like myſticall meaning upon the words <hi>[Sion and Jacob]</hi> in <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Prophecie: but 'tis not the delivering of your meaning ſo darkely, nor the preſſing of it upon the Readers beleefe with ſuch an irrationall neceſſity, that will ought availe you. For <hi>[Sion]</hi> doth ſignifie in this place, the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> of whom the Deliverer, that is, Chriſt our Saviour was to be borne; and <hi>[Jacob]</hi> is never uſed but for the perſon of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or the poſterity of <hi>Jacob:</hi> which laſt acception is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it in this Prophecie; and how then ſhall the turning away <hi>of ungodlineſſe from Jacob</hi> be underſtood, but of ſaving <hi>[all Iſrael]</hi>

And conſequently this Prophecy alſo doth ſhew the Nationall converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> after the fulneſſe of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted <hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in; or when the time comes in which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the wonderfull deliverance of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (not a part, as now) but) all that were left of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall together with them ſerve the Lord. But [<hi>theſe conjectures</hi> (you ſay) <hi>deſtroy one another, for if the calling of the Iews ſhall be after the fulnes of the calling of the Gentiles, then all the Gentiles that ſhal be left cannot be called through the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliverance of the Jews.</hi>] Thus no doubt you would have it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you cannot thus apprehend it; for I have before in a margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall note, which you would take no notice of, (nor of ſome others which would have given good light to the reader in the totall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this truth) I have there, I ſay, as wel as he here diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the full number of the elect that were ſucceſſively to be cal'd out of the Nations of the ſubſtituted <hi>Gentiles</hi> before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and the full calling of all unbeleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> whatſoever at and through the extraordinary reſtauration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Now to ſay that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted after, or at the filling up of the full number of the elect of the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are appointed to be call'd before, and at the <hi>Jews</hi> generall converſion (&amp; before our Saviours comming, which ſhall be at the deliverance of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> not long after their calling, and even ſuddenly after their return) &amp; that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted before the calling and comming in of all unbeleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that are to be converted through their wonderfull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at our Saviour's deſcending; is not to affirme, that all <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be call'd to the Chriſtian Faith before the <hi>Jewes</hi> converſion, and yet many of them left to be call'd through the <hi>Jewes</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as any one, that is not more willing to have the truth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, then to ſatisfie himſelfe or others therein, may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: For that the Chriſtian Nations have beene the people of God in the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſtead, ever ſince the Apoſtles turned from them to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is knowne to all Chriſtians that endeavour to know any thing; and that there are farre more Nations then theſe, that as yet embrace not the Chriſtian Faith, experience at this day witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

For by [<hi>the building of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of</hi> David] is meant the reſtoring of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> by [<hi>the</hi> Gentiles <hi>on whom Gods name is call'd</hi>] are meant the Chriſtians; and by <hi>[the reſidue of men]</hi> are meant the Nations which ſhall not till then be call'd to the Chriſtian faith: and of this comming in of all <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations together upon the foreſaid deliverance of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> I doe indeed take [<hi>the fulneſſe of the</hi> Gentiles] which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, to be underſtood. <hi>So that untill the fulneſſe of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall come in;</hi> is, untill the time in which God hath appointed thus to bring in all <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations together, be neere at hand, be ſhortly to begin: then ſhall the <hi>Jewes</hi> be converted, that this may be effected: and thus the Apoſtle doth prophecie of the generall converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> too: and that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (whom you your ſelfe commend for a renowned Author) did thus underſtand the Apoſtle you may ſee <hi>page</hi> 54 of his Commentaries on the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> where affirming, that from the time of the <hi>Jewes</hi> rejection, the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hath beene taken into <hi>Iſraels</hi> roome, he ſaith, <hi>Fóque loce apud Deum tantiſper babenda, dum veteri populo ſuo denuò miſericordiam conſecuto, plenitudo gentium introierit;</hi> and indeede the Apoſtles own words in the 12. and 15. <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter</hi> doe confirme this; for there he ſhewes, that as the fall and caſting away of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was an occaſion of the converſion of the ſubſtituted part of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſo <hi>their fulneſſe, their receiving againe,</hi> ſhould be an occaſion of the comming in of all other <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations whatſoever. And though you ſay [<hi>that this laſt conjecture</hi> (to wit, touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all <hi>Gentiles</hi> whatſoever through the deliverance of the <hi>Jewes</hi>) <hi>doth deſtroy a maine Tenet of the</hi> Millenaries, <hi>who ſay that the</hi> Jewes <hi>ſhall rule over all the Nations and hold them in ſubjection till the end of the thouſand yeares, and then theſe prophane Nations ſhall riſe again in armes againſt the</hi> Jews,] it is onely ſpoken not prov'd: and though you will not beleeve God in all this; yet if you will beleeve what
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113937:72"/>long experience hath verified in others, you muſt needs beleeve this alſo.

And yet you have not done, For [<hi>the greateſt part of the prophecies</hi> (which ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> proſperity after their returne) <hi>are exponed of the Chriſtian Church</hi> (you) ſay <hi>in other paſſages of the new Teſtament.</hi>] Surely if there be no better paſſages in the new Teſtament to expound them ſo, then the prophecies of <hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are, there be none at all; as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doth by this time, I thinke, plainly underſtand. But [<hi>Ier.</hi> 31.1. <hi>is exponed</hi> (you ſay) <hi>in</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.18. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31. in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10.16, 17. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. containes the ſame words with <hi>ch.</hi> 31.31. ſo doth that of <hi>chap.</hi> 33.6. and to the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>chap.</hi> 50.19. and that of <hi>Ezek. chap.</hi> 34. <hi>concerning the gathering and feeding the ſheepe, is exponed by our Saviour Iohn</hi> 10 11.16. <hi>and that of chap.</hi> 39. <hi>is correſpondent with the prophecies of Ioel, whereof we ſpake before. and that of Zech.</hi> 10. <hi>is one with Ier.</hi> 23 6.8. <hi>and other that are handled before.</hi>] And what other were they? certainely you have not anſwered one of all theſe prophecies that are alledged to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> peaceable and proſperous condition after their returne. And the anſwere that you have made to them which concerne their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, doe leave the reader as doubtfull and unſatisfied, as your ſhuffling together of theſe prophecies here doth. For the firſt words which I have alledged, out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. are at the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> and not at the firſt <hi>ver.</hi> but this <hi>verſe</hi> was quoted in the margent of your Bible in the 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 6. at the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> and that was enough to make you ſay, that the whole <hi>chap. of Jeremiah is meant of the

And much leſſe will it follow, that any thing which is prophecied as proper to the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular, or as oppoſed to other Nations, ſhould yet be underſtood of other Nations. For doubtleſſe, if ſuch prophecies belong not to the <hi>Iews</hi> onely, no promiſes can be ſo properly, diſtinctly, and plainly made to any Nation, which can aſſure that Nation that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it, and to no other. You ſay next [<hi>that the prophecy Ier.</hi> 31. at the 31. <hi>verſe is exponed in Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. &amp;c.] There indeed it is wholly repeated, but expounded it is not, unleſſe the ſame prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth expound it ſelfe, which is to make it both the text and the comment: ſuch poore ſhifts are you put to, whilſt you had rather ſay any thing, to winne the unſtable, or to hide the truth from the unlearned, then acknowledge it for a truth. And to whom did the Apoſtle alledge this prophecy, but to the <hi>Jews</hi> of whom it was ſpoken by the Prophet? and why did he alledge it to them, but to ſhew that Chriſt Jeſus was the Mediator of the new Covenant, which God had promiſed to make with them, and that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the old Covenant, were by his death become voyd and unprofitable? that hereby he might at once eſtabliſh the faith of the beleeving <hi>Jews;</hi> and, if it had been poſſible, have moved the whole Nation at that time to embrace the Covenant of the Goſpel; of which this prophecy doth plainly witneſſe they ſhall be one day partakers; even the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together. And as this prophecy cannot expound it ſelfe (and is indeed ſo plaine that it needs no expoſition) ſo it doth no more expound the other prophecies (which you ſay, <hi>are the ſame with it</hi>) as it is repeated by the Apoſtle, then it doth as it is delivered by the Prophet. And they being all to be accompliſht to the <hi>Jews</hi> at the ſame time, at the reſtoring of their Kingdom, this prophecy is as much expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the others, as the others are by this, if not more. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113937:73"/>this containes ſpirituall benefits onely, thoſe <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. at the 37. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>chap.</hi> 33. at the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>chap.</hi> 50. at the 19. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c. doe containe ſpirituall and temporal benefits both: for they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> withall, their returne unto, and proſperity in their owne country; and ſo declare both where and when the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhall be made with them.

And you will have our Saviour's words to expound this prophecy too, becauſe our Saviour and the Prophet doe uſe the ſame Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, to wit, the word <hi>[ſheepe]</hi> to expreſſe men by. But the ſheepe the Prophet ſpeakes of, are the ſcattered <hi>Jews</hi> and none elſe: and the ſheepe our Saviour ſpake of, were the <hi>Jewes</hi> impli'd in the words <hi>[of this fold,]</hi> and the ſubſtituted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> expreſt in the words <hi>[other ſheepe]</hi> and all Nations together intimated in the words <hi>[one fold:]</hi> for after the calling of the <hi>[other ſheepe]</hi> the ſubſtituted <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, there ſhall be one fold and one ſhepheard,</hi> that is, one Church and Kingdome over all the world, under one King, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore when you can prove this prophecie in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to be meant of <hi>Jewes,</hi> and Chriſtians, and all other Nations, you may have ſome colour to ſay, that our Saviour's words <hi>Joh.</hi> the 10. doe expound it.

And thus it appeares by the three Prophecies which you have barely referr'd to three paſſages in the New-Teſtament, whereof the firſt is miſtaken, the ſecond the ſelfe-ſame Prophecie that is referred; and the third neither ſpoken of in the Text to which it is referr'd, nor of any affinity with it, in the contents thereof; by this I ſay, it appeares, that being unable to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable anſwer to any of theſe Prophecies, you had no other way to hold up your credit, amongſt your friends, but by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pretending <hi>[that the greateſt part of theſe Prophecies are exponed to their hands in the writings of the Apoſtles:]</hi> but whatſoever the reſt may doe, I preſume the learned of your opinion, will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the few and meane inſtances, which you have brought to make good your aſſertion: for doubtleſſe by ſuch references, with which you have anſwered theſe Prophecies, you may ſhun the force of any Argument, and expound any text of Scripture, as you liſt. Now in the laſt place you taxe me for [<hi>omitting the</hi> 12. <hi>and</hi> 13. <hi>ver. in the teſtimony of</hi> Jer. <hi>chap.</hi> 33. <hi>and for overſlipping like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the</hi> 18. <hi>and</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi>] But not one of theſe verſes was in that part of the chapter, which I have cited; and therefore they were neither overſlipt, nor purpoſely omitted; as you have purpoſely omitted in the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> theſe words, <hi>[againe, in this place which is deſolate, without man and without beaſt;]</hi> and in the 13. <hi>verſe</hi> theſe, <hi>[and in the places about Jeruſalem—ſhall the flocks paſſe againe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of him that telleth them]</hi> that ſo you might make way for your myſticall interpretation, in the entrance whereof you doe ſo ſawcily flout at the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, ſaying <hi>[what? is this the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, that ſheep ſhall lie in his Citie?]</hi> certainly the chiefeſt glory of Chriſts Kingdome is, that mercy and truth ſhall meet together; and peace and righteouſneſſe kiſſe each other: but yet the promiſed fertility and pleaſantneſſe of the

If <hi>Adam</hi> had not fell, and ſo ſinne had not entred into the world; ſhould there not have been eating and drinking, buying and ſelling, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Juſtice, marrying and giving in marriage? you will not deny it: and might there not alſo have been offerings and ſacrifices made unto God; as of incenſe, in token of Gods hearing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delighted with their prayers: and of the beſt of their fruits, and of their cattell, in token of mens praiſing of, and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto God for the increaſe of them? doubtleſſe there might. And what hinders then, that in the Kingdome of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> there ſhould not be ſuch ſacrifices offered alſo?

But you will ſay, are not then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113937:76"/>aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt? hath not the ſubſtance ſwallowed up the ſhadowes? true, they are ceaſt in regard of that end to which they were formerly us'd: they can no longer ſhew, that Chriſt ſhall come to ſuffer againe, (and therefore the place where alone they could be offer'd, and the people by whom alone they could be offer'd, are both forſaken, the Temple is deſtroy'd, and the people ſcatter'd) but ſeeing the Prophets have frequently declar'd, that at our Saviours appearing, the City and Temple ſhall be rebuilt, and the people and Prieſthood reſtor'd; why ſhould wee not thinke, that as ſacrifices of prayſe and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may againe be required, ſo other ſacrifices may alſo? but how? ſurely not as in time paſt, to ſhew what Chriſt ſhould doe for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but to witneſſe to the generations then to come, what he hath done for ſinners, or perhaps to be a teſtimony of the publick acknowledgement of, and repentance for ſinne. For whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. at the 18. <hi>verſ. Now where remiſſion of ſinnes is, there is no more offering for ſinne:</hi> it is to be underſtood in relation to Chriſts ſatisfaction for ſinne, who by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified: and ſhall appeare againe the ſecond time, unto them that looke for him, without ſinne unto ſalvation; that is, without ſinne any more to be imputed unto him, whereby he ſhould be conſtrained to lay downe his life againe for ſinners; ſo that it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, where remiſſion of ſinne is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured through the death of the Mediator, there is no more offering for ſinne by way of ſatisfaction, or as repreſenting any ſatisfaction againe to be made: but yet there may be offering for ſinne by way of ſignification, and manifeſtation of an atonement formerly made, or at leaſt of publike confeſſion of, and repentance for ſinne. And why then ſhould the reſtoring of this thing amongſt the reſt, give diſtaſte to any, and (upon a groundleſſe miſtake of being reſtored as types of a Mediator to ſuffer for ſinne, which were to offer them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law) become an occaſion of rejecting ſo many other things yet to be fulfilled: as namely, the calling and reſtoring of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the rebuilding of their City and Temple, the making of their Land more fruitfull then ever, the deſcending of Chriſt to deliver them from their enemies and to reigne over them, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of all Nations to worſhip God with them? all which are ſo plainely and ſo often foretold; that for my owne part, could I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113937:76"/>give my ſelfe (much leſſe another) no ſatisfaction in this particular about ſacrifices onely: I ſhould yet thinke it ſhould be done, becauſe God hath ſaid it; though I knew not to what end and purpoſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thinke that the things before mentioned, ſhould not be properly fulfilled, which as they are frequently foretold, and that as well diſtinctly and by themſelves, as together with this; ſo alſo they are ſo clearely foretold, that it is not poſſible any thing ſhould be more plainely ſpoken.

Luke 2.30. <hi>It is ſaid of him, not onely that he was</hi> a juſt man and devout, waiting for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſrael, and the Holy Ghoſt was upon him, <hi>but likewiſe,</hi> It was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not ſee death before he had ſeen the Lord Chriſt, and he came by the Spirit into the Temple. <hi>All which particulars ſerve very much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe credit unto his teſtimony, who ſaith:</hi> Mine eyes have ſeene thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the glory of thy people <hi>Iſrael.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113937:77"/>of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I will alſo give thee for a light unto the <hi>Gentles,</hi> that thou maiſt be my ſalvation unto the ends of the earth: and <hi>cha.</hi> 52.9.

And yet if it had been meant of old <hi>Simeon,</hi> it would have made the more with me: ſeeing the word <hi>[firſt]</hi> alone compared with the order of <hi>Simeons</hi> words, <hi>[a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael]</hi> had plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, that a ſubſtituted part of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be cal'd, before the Nationall converſion of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> From this you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew, that <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, which no Chriſtian can doubt of: and then repeating the prophecy, you ſay. <hi>[Wee may ſee that he declares there the fulfilling (at that time) of the prophecy, Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 52. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and <hi>chap.</hi> 60. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.3.19. and <hi>chap.</hi> 62. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.11.] How? at that time? certainly amongſt prophecies touching the ſame thing, one may be more plainly delivered then another, and ſo may give ſome light for the true underſtanding of the other. But to ſay that one prophecy doth ſhew the fulfilling of another, is a ridiculous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: ſeeing it is not the prophecying of the ſame thing, but the actuall performance of it, that ſhews the fulfilling thereof. And therefore <hi>Simeon</hi> who prophecied of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and reſtoring of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> could not herein declare the fulfilling (at that time) of <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> prophecies; unleſſe you can prove, that to foretel what ſhould be done, is to declare what was done. And thus <hi>Simeon's</hi> words which you have alledged to prove that <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> prophecies were then fulfilled, doe indeed moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that they were not fulfilled. And the reaſons which you bring to confirme your doctrine, are as meane, as the doctrine is maimed. For [<hi>the faithfull</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are bidden to rejoyce at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt; and ſo did Simeon when he ſaw him.</hi>] No doubt but the faithfull, that ſaw Chriſt when he was come, did rejoyce? that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113937:78"/>he was come, and ſo did the faithfull too before Chriſt's comming, and before <hi>Iſa.</hi> prophecied, rejoyce that he ſhould come: for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſaw my day and rejoyced.</hi> Yea this was a thing ever performed by the Saints from the beginning of the world. But yet it is not expreſt in the text, that <hi>Simeon</hi> rejoyced; neither doth the Prophet in any of theſe texts which you have cited bid the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rejoyce at the comming of Chriſt, but <hi>chap.</hi> 52. at the 9. <hi>ver.</hi> he calls to the waſte places of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>breake forth into joy</hi>—<hi>for the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jeruſalem.</hi> Where the Prophet uſeth the like forme of ſpeech, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> doth in his prophecy, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 68. &amp;c. And therefore <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the preter perfect tenſe. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people,</hi> doth no more prove that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was then redeemed (for which purpoſe you have before alledged it <hi>page.</hi> 8.) then this prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth, that it was redeemed when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecied. And in confeſſing, that this prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (which agrees ſo well both in matter and forme with the firſt words of <hi>Zacharias</hi>) was not fulfilled before Chriſt's firſt comming, you doe as good as confeſſe, that it is not to be fulfilled til his next comming. For ſeeing the Prophet cals to the waſte places of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to rejoyce, and ſpeakes of God's redeeming <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as of comforting his people; it is manifeſt, that this prophecy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fulfilled, til the city it ſelfe be againe reſtored, as is implyed in our Saviour's prophecy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. and expreſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. and <hi>Iſa. chap.</hi> 60. and 62. and in many other places. This is your firſt parallell, for which you had no ground in the text. The reſt are theſe. <hi>[Chriſt is called the ſalvation of the Lord; and Simeon ſaith, My eyes have ſeene thy ſalvation.

Which doe indeed ſhew that Chriſt is to be <hi>[the glory of his people Iſrael]</hi> at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:113937:78"/>his next appearing, and not before. For ſeeing to be <hi>the glory of his people,</hi> implies a greater happines to belong to the <hi>Iews</hi> of whom the Redeemer came; then to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom he is ſaid to be a light; is it likely that this ſhould be fulfilled, when now and then a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould ſeeke God amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or rather when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in generall ſhould ſeeke God amidſt the whole Nation of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> or rather I ſay when (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>the Tribes of</hi> Iacob <hi>ſhall be rayſed up, and the preſerved of</hi> Iſrael <hi>reſtored; when they ſhall come from the North, and from the Weſt, and from the land of Sinim. When the waſte and deſolate places, and the land of their deſtruction ſhall be even now too narrow by reaſon of the inhabitants, and they that ſwallowed them up ſhall be far away. When the Lord ſhall feed them that oppreſſe them with their owne fleſh, and they ſhall be drunken with their owne blood, as with ſweet wine, and all fleſh ſhall know, that the Lord is their Saviour, and their Redeemer, the mighty one of</hi> Jacob. <hi>When the glory of the Lord is riſen upon Sion, and the Gentiles ſhall come to their light, and Kings to the brightnes of her riſing. When the abundance of the ſea ſhall be converted unto her; and the forces of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall come unto her.

When all the flocks of Kedar ſhall be gathered together unto her, and the</hi> Rams <hi>of</hi> Nebaioth <hi>ſhall miniſter unto her, when they ſhall come up with acxcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on God's altar, and God ſhall glorify the houſe of his glory. When the glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>ſhall come unto her the firre tree, the pine tree, and the boxe tree together, to beautify the place of God's Sanctuary; and when God ſhall make the place of his feet glorious. When the Nation and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that will not ſerve Sion ſhall periſh, yea ſhall be utterly waſted. When violence ſhall no more be heard in her land, waſting nor deſtruction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her borders, but ſhe ſhall call her walls ſalvation, and her gates praiſe. When the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall ſee her righteouſnes, and all Kings her glory, when ſhe ſhall be called</hi> Heph-Zibah, <hi>and her land</hi> Benlah. In a word, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be cal'd, <hi>The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord:</hi> and Sion ſhall be called, <hi>Sought out, a City not forſaken.</hi> When the time comes wherein all this, and much more (which is revealed in the <hi>chapters</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cited by you) ſhall come to paſſe; then, and not til then ſhall our Saviour declare himſelfe, <hi>to be the glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> hath foretold. And ſo by the teſtimony of theſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113937:79"/>prophecies, that part of <hi>Simeon's</hi> prophecy, which concernes the glory of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> is to be referred wholly to our Saviour's ſecond comming; when as well <hi>[the reſidue of men]</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are yet uncal'd, as the <hi>Gentiles [on whom God's Name is already cal'd]</hi> ſhall all goe up to worſhip the Lord at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> ſhall all ſeeke ſalvation amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and not the <hi>Iewes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And therefore when the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be ſo united, as theſe and many other prophecies doe foreſhew; there is to be no diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all betwixt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or betwixt them and any other nation in the practiſe of religious duties. Which thing too this marginall note doth ſo clearely prove out of the prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> alledged by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> that you could make no better reply to it, then to call it a long tailed note, and a frivolous diſcourſe. And whereas, you ſay [<hi>that there was an unanimous conſent in the true worſhip of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Jewes and other Nations, when they did conveen in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Synode Act.</hi> 15.] Surely there was not one whole City, and much leſſe was there any one Nation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at that time converted. And if a few <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould become Chriſtians, you might as well infer from this, that there were an unanimous conſent in the worſhip of God betwixt Chriſtians and the Turkiſh Nations: as you can conclude from that meeting or from all that were then converted, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> and (any, much leſſe all) other Nations were united in the true worſhip of God. And indeed the uniting of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> into one Church, ſo often and ſo plainly foretold by the Prophets, and confirmed by our Saviour <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. is not of ſome <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely, as it was in the firſt dayes of the Goſpel: nor of ſome Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and a few <hi>Jewes,</hi> as it hath been ſince the converſion of the ſubſtituted Nations of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> nor of all the <hi>Jewes</hi> and ſome <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; nor of all the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but of all the Tribes of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and all the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

And yet you ſeeme to be ſo confident of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantneſſe of this expoſition, that you thus peremptorily conclude <hi>[It is manifeſt that in this note is a twofold errour, one inſerting the words in the prophecy, which are not in it; another in miſinterpreting the Apoſtle's words]</hi> Certainely it is very manifeſt what ſpirit was predominant in you, when you penned theſe bold and lowd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.

Nay doe you not ſay before <hi>[and howbeit the Apoſtle cite them ſo?]</hi> whom then doe you here accuſe of error, me, or him? And as for miſinterpreting the words of the Apoſtle, it is already ſhewen, that you would faine father your miſinterpreting of it on the Apoſtle. To which this may be added, That the Prophet doth make a plaine diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the people meant by <hi>[the Tabernacle of David]</hi> and the people meant by <hi>[the remnant of Edom, and all the heathen which are called by Gods Name.]</hi> For he ſaith that thoſe meant by the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of David</hi> ſhall poſſeſſe theſe. What? can the ſame people be the poſſeſſours and the poſſeſſed? ſurely ſo it muſt be according to your interpreting of the <hi>[building of Davids Tabernacle]</hi> of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> ſeeing in the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> not onely the <hi>remnant of Edom,</hi> but the heathen that were to be called in the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſteed are plainly

                           <hi>And conſequently, that the</hi> Jewes <hi>endeavour to hinder the growth of the Goſpel</hi> (1. Theſſ. 2.14.15.) <hi>was a ſure proofe of the converſion of the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>&amp; their owne rejection, who unto the death of Chriſt were the peculiar people of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>not wholly caſt off, until by their wilful unbeleife, they forced the Apoſtles to turne from them to other Nations</hi> (Act. 13.44, 45, 46.) <hi>to whom God had not formerly revealed himſelfe, &amp; therefore could not at that time be ſaid [to returne] unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>whom he had but then receiv'd no, nor to the</hi> Jewes, <hi>whom he had then (and not til then) quite forſaken. So that if we conſider the [Returning] of God here mention'd in the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to be appliable only to the</hi> Jews, <hi>to whom alone God had ſo long before made himſelfe known: &amp; yet that the</hi> Jews <hi>were ſhortly after the calling of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>quite forſaken, we muſt needs grant, that their great happines here foretold hath not been yet injoyed, but ſhall be, when the fulneſſe of the ſuccedaneous</hi> Gentiles <hi>is come in. And wherefore did the Apoſtle change the Prophet's [in that day will I raiſe up] into [After this will I returne and build?] wherefore, I ſay, did he, or rather the Holy Ghoſt in him, make choyce of this paraphraſe in place of the text, if not of purpoſe to make that which hath been ſaid, the more plainly appeare? to wit, that the day of the</hi> Jewes <hi>deliverance, is to await the accompliſhment of the ſurroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Gentiles <hi>vocation. For though this conſolatory prophecy, according to the order of the things revealed to the Prophet, hath relation only to a foregoing judgement denounced againſt the</hi> Jewes, <hi>yet it is not therefore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113937:81"/>miſinferred here by the Apoſtle, as a ſubſequent too of the anticipated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the</hi> Gentiles: <hi>and that becauſe the very ſame time, which was foreappointed by God, for the execution of that puniſhment upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> Jewes, <hi>was alſo foreappointed by him, to be the time for the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his mercy, towards the ſubſtituted</hi> Gentiles: <hi>as theſe next words</hi> [that the reſidue of men might ſeeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my Name is cal'd] <hi>doe moſt clearely intimate. For what is meant by</hi> [the reſidue of men,] <hi>but the remainder of thoſe Nations, which are not to be converted, til the foreſaid redemption of the</hi> Jewes? <hi>(their redemption I ſay, as well out of all countries into which they are ſcattered, and from all Nations amongſt whom (as was foretold) they have been ſifted (ſo many hundred yeares) as from all their ſinnes, which moved God to uſe ſuch ſeverity towards them.

And whereas you ſay further [<hi>that in the words of</hi> Amos <hi>immediately preceding, the Lord was offended with Iſrael, and when he ſent the ſalvation of God and glory of Iſrael among them, it may be truly ſaid, that he returned unto them.</hi>] If you had ſaid, and when he <hi>ſhall raiſe up the Tabernacle of</hi> David, <hi>that is fallen, and cloſe up the breaches thereof, &amp;c.</hi> he may be truly ſaid to return unto them; you had ſaid the truth: for the Prophet ſaith it is this, and not the firſt comming of our Saviour, that declares Gods returne to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the full accompliſhment of the wrath before denounc't againſt it, which wrath had not wholly ſeized upon them, untill <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were diſperſed alſo at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans:</hi> and before this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were turned from the <hi>Jewes</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo that God had then ceaſed to be their God, as our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. and therefore when he ſhall againe become their God, as he hath foretold he will, at the rebuilding of <hi>Davids Tabernacle,</hi> then ſhall this <hi>[Returne]</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, be fulfill'd unto them: for as God cannot be ſaid to returne to a people in reſpect of a donation of outward and temporall bleſſings, unleſſe they be firſt taken from them; ſo neither can he be ſaid to returne to a people in reſpect of a participation of inward and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, unleſſe they be firſt depriv'd of the meanes of ſalvation, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113937:82"/>formerly they enjoy'd. And it is very remarkable here, how wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering you are both in your interpretation and application of God's <hi>[Returning]</hi> mention'd by the Apoſtle: for firſt you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of Gods returning to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in calling them by the preaching of the Goſpel, and preſently after you underſtand it of his returning to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in ſending Chriſt among them; of whom nevertheleſſe, you have hitherto deny'd, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie doth ſpeake.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113937:82"/>therefore I much doubt, whether he would in the very next line, by the ſame word indifferently comprehend both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is to be ſav'd muſt needs have relation to the <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that was before ſaid to be in blindneſſe.

And whereas you ſay [<hi>that the Prophecie, Eſa.</hi> 66. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>was fulfill'd truely (albeit not fully) when the believing Church travelled, and brought forth ſo great multitudes in one day, as may be call'd a Nation, as</hi> 3000. <hi>and</hi> 5000. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>and chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>and chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.17, 18.20.26. <hi>beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great and miraculous converſions, whereof we read in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories;</hi>] Certainly your application ſailes you very much. For firſt the Prophet ſpeaks of the converſion of a whole Nation, not of halfe a Nation; and much leſſe of ſo ſmall a number, as you (to maintaine your cauſe) would perſwade us to take for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, he ſpeaks but of one Nation (to wit, the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi>) and not of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both; as you in theſe inſtances doe interpret him. Thirdly, he ſpeaks of <hi>Sions</hi> travelling, when ſhe ſhould returne from her unbeliefe (as the contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prophecies in the ſame chapter doe ſhew) and not before ſhe fell into unbeliefe; as the converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was. And fourthly, the converſion he foreſhewes, is to be ſo ſodaine, that it is ſaid to be performed <hi>[at once]</hi> which connot be affirmed of a converſion of any ordinarie continuance, and how then can it be affirmed of a converſion of ſo many yeares and ages,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113937:84"/>as you underſtand it of, in applying it to the whole time under the Goſpel? For ſuppoſe that a great ſumme of mony were to be paid to you <hi>[at once]</hi> would you give the creditour leave to make this conſtruction of it, that it was to be paid by him and his heirs, to you and your heires, untill it were all paid? doubtleſſe you would not: and yet as if all the time betwixt Chriſts firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming, were not time enough to be underſtood by <hi>[one day, and at once]</hi> you tell us too [<hi>It is certaine, it was in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd at their returning from</hi> Babel, <hi>for then they reared up their walls, they planted Vineyards, &amp;c.</hi>] Who ever heard of ſuch a large <hi>[at once?]</hi> of an <hi>[at once]</hi> to begin at the deliverance of the <hi>Jewes</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to continue to the next appearing of Chriſt? what? could the Prophet have made the ſpeedie execution of that he ſpeaks of, a matter of ſo great admiration, if it ſhould have been any long time in fulfilling? or ſhall we ſay, that <hi>Adino</hi> the Eznite, who lift up his <hi>Speare againſt eight hundred, whom he ſlew at one time,</hi> did it at ſo many ſeverall times as there were men ſlaine by him? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. or that when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let not the Lord be angry, and I will ſpeake yet but this once, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 32. it is to be underſtood that he ſpake more then that once? or that when the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Joſhua, Ye ſhall goe about the City once, Joſh.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. it was to be done many times together? (for in all theſe texts there are the ſame words in the originall, as are here in the Prophet) were not this moſt wilfully to contradict the text? and yet you can very modeſtly, reverently, and righteouſly affirme that [<hi>It is certaine this [once] was in part fulfill'd at the</hi> Jewes <hi>returning from</hi> Babel.] But where are the reaſons that prove this certainty, ſeeing there is neither in this verſe, nor in the whole chapter, any mention of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or of walls and Vineyards? and if there had been mention of rearing up their walls and Vineyards: how could you underſtand it properly here, who take it figuratively, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 14.? ſo that all this being laid together, to wit, that this Prophecie doth ſpeake of the converſion of a whole Nation, of but one Nation, of a Nation formerly given up to unbeliefe, and at once againe to return to the truth; it ſhould me thinks, be motive enough to make any partiall or impartiall Reader, to underſtand the accompliſhment of it particularly of the Nationall converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, by the plentifull effuſion of Gods Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113937:84"/>on them before the great and terrible Day of the Lords appearing, as <hi>Joel</hi> hath prophecied. And as for that which followes, any one that hath but halfe an eye may perceive how well your eye-ſight ſerv'd you, when you conceived, that the Prophecie <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. was alledged by me to prove the temporall Kingdome of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> who have alledg'd it onely as a reaſon to ſhew, that this Prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> could not be fulfill'd at the returning of the <hi>Jewes</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe the meanes of ſalvation (the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, as our Saviour cals it) was then amongſt them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of which they were to be deſtitute before the accompliſhment of this Prophecie, which ſhewes their converſion to it againe. And he may perceive too how you take <hi>non cauſa pro causà,</hi> how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly you impute unto me the alledging of the accompliſhment of our Saviours Prophecie; to ſhew that <hi>Joels</hi> Prophecie was not fulfill'd, which was indeed before prov'd by ſuch reaſons as you could not anſwer.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113937:87"/>peace over all the world, as the following words of the foregoing prophecy of <hi>Iſa.</hi> &amp; <hi>Micah,</hi> doe manifeſt. <hi>And he ſhall judge amongſt the Nations, &amp; ſhall rebuke many people, &amp; they ſhal breake their ſwords into plow ſhares &amp; their ſpeares into pruning books, nation ſhal not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne warre any more.</hi> With which agreeth that of <hi>Hoſea chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>In that day I will make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them, with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and with the creeping things of the ground.

The Scripture hath coucluded all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne, that the promiſe by ſaith in Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them who beleeve. <hi>Here the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking of the</hi> Jewes <hi>onely, but generally both of</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles; <hi>and ſo farre muſt his words be extended thereto, ſeeing he is ſpeaking of them, ver.</hi> 30. <hi>and</hi> 31. <hi>and ſo the meaning of ver.</hi> 32. <hi>is; It was the counſel of God to ſuffer both</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>to fall into unbeliefe or diſobedience (as the mond</hi> Apeitheia <hi>likewiſe imports, and the word</hi> ſin <hi>teaches</hi> Gal. 3.) <hi>that he might ſave all his elect both of</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>after one way, not by their workes, but of his mercy onely.

Neither will the text which you have alledged out of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. (as parallell to this in the former tranſlation) any thing availe you. For there is a vaſt difference betwixt theſe propoſitions. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin.</hi> And, <hi>God hath concluded all in unbeliefe.</hi> The firſt is univerſally, and actually true; ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing all men are ſinners; as well beleevers, as unbeleevers. But the laſt is not univerſally, and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true; ſeeing all men are not unbeleevers, nor ever were ſince the firſt promiſe of a Saviour. Yea the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. that <hi>the Scripture hath concluded all under ſinne,</hi> for this very cauſe, to wit, <hi>that the promiſe by faith of Ieſus Chriſt might be given to them that beleeve.</hi> That is, to them that are not concluded in unbeliefe, albeit they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113937:88"/>are concluded under ſin. And therfore it muſt needs be granted, that the 32. <hi>ver. Rom.</hi> 11. is applyed by the Apoſtle to ſome men onely, and not to all; to wit, to the unbeleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> in oppoſition to the beleeving <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And conſequently muſt of neceſſity too be meant of all the Tribes, none excepted; becauſe it cannot be meant of all <hi>Jewes,</hi> none excepted. And if this be not evidence enough to make you underſtand the 32. <hi>ver.</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, wee have undeniable experience to helpe cleare your eye-ſight: For tell us, what are the many numerous multitudes of the unbeleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> diſperſt at this day amongſt the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> are they the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or are they not? if they are, then were all the Tribes concluded in unbeliefe; if they are not, then tell us what Tribe, or Tribes are wanting, that fell not, or continued not in unbeleife with the reſt. For ſurely in the opinion of great Divines the Holy Ghoſt hath reckoned up by St. <hi>John Rev.</hi> 7. all the Tribes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and to be converted, not long before the deſtruction of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet. And therefore it is ſomewhat hard to conceive, how a man of ſuch underſtanding as you conceite your ſelfe to have, could notwithſtanding ſo much evidence of Scripture and experience condemne this concluſion. Therefore it cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be maintained, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are as yet one ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. And as for the fallacy of conſequence, let the reader judge, whether it be on our part, who ſay, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall not be united into one Church, until the whole Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> be converted, and the foreſaid prophecies accompliſhed: or on yours, who granting, that theſe prophecies doe foreſhew their uniting, doe affirme that they are already thus united, although not one of theſe prophecies be fulfilled, nor any one Tribe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But to prove that the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are united into one Church, you alledge [<hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;c. Remember that yee being in times paſt Gentiles in the fleſh—that at that time yee were without Chriſt—but now are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt—who hath made both one, and broken downe the midwall of partition betweene us—for to make in himſelfe one new man.</hi>] And is St. <hi>Paul</hi> then contrary to himſelfe? what? would he have wiſht himſelfe accurſed from Chriſt <hi>for his brethren, his Kinſmen according to the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 3.? or would he have ſaid, <hi>that going about to eſtabliſh their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113937:89"/>they had not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> chap. 1. v. 3. or <hi>Even ſo have theſe alſo now not beleeved, that through your mercy they alſo may obtaine mercie,</hi> chap. 11. ver. 31. would he have ſaid all this of the <hi>Jewes</hi> (and much more to this purpoſe) if the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> had then equally embrac't the Goſpel? if the Tribes had been alreadie one bodie, or then likely to become one bodie with the believing <hi>Gentiles?</hi> doubtleſſe he would not. And therefore, Firſt I may ſay, that theſe words <hi>[who hath made both one]</hi> are to be referr'd to the meriting cauſe or purchaſe of their union alreadie wrought on Chriſt's par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, by the ſhedding of his blood for them: and not to the actuall accompliſhing of this purchaſed union in them; which was to be performed in the time fore-appointed by God for it. For as in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>chapter,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith likewiſe in the pretertenſe. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The words could not be meant <hi>de facto,</hi> of the actuall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of theſe heavenly places by the Saints then on earth: but <hi>de jure,</hi> of their right unto them by Faith in Chriſt, in like manner he might ſay, that Chriſt had made the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles [one]</hi> by purchaſing their union, by paying the price of their reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God, and amongſt themſelves, although it were not to be fulfill'd by an actuall diſpenſation of it unto them, untill the fulneſſe both of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould come in, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 12.25. Or ſecondly, I may ſay (as you your ſelfe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the union betwixt the two people in your anſwer to my next words) that the union the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of, is not to be underſtood of an actuall union betwixt the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> then living: but of an actuall union betwixt the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then begun under the New Teſtament, and the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> formerly gathered under the Old Teſtament, (both which were to make one new man, that is, that one glorified Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and myſticall bodie of Saints which ſhall come with Chriſt their head at his next appearing. Whereas the union which wee treat of, and which is fore-ſhew'd by the preceding Prophecies, is to be of all Nations on earth in one viſible Church. And thirdly as I ſay not, that all the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but all the Tribes were concluded in unbeliefe, ſo I denie not that the firſt fruits of the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Goſpel are joyned unto the Church of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113937:89"/>that this is ſuch an uniting of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Prophecies doe reveale, or that it is any more an uniting of them into one Church, then the calling of the believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> before Chriſts comming, was an uniting of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> into one Church, and therefore I thus retort your following Argument againſt your ſelfe.

You ſay next, [<hi>that there is a vaſt difference betwixt the calling of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the calling of the</hi> Jewes <hi>under the new: becauſe the</hi> Gentiles <hi>then converted, were very few, even nothing in compariſon of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Jewes <hi>ſince the Goſpel.</hi>] And ſuppoſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> were more, yet ſeeing no one Tribe of the <hi>Jewes</hi> hath been converted ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt, as no one Nation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was before the incarnation, why ſhould theſe firſt fruits of the <hi>Jewes</hi> (though more) be taken for the converſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> rather then thoſe firſt fruits of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (though fewer) be taken for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> But yet it is but ſuppos'd by me, and but ſaid by you, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> converted under the Goſpel, are more then the <hi>Gentiles</hi> converted under the Law were. For moſt of the <hi>Jewes</hi> converted under the Goſpel are mention'd in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and beſides the many <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that became Proſelytes in the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and powerfull eſtate of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> wee read <hi>Heſter</hi> the 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that in the very time of their captivitie, <hi>many of the people of the Land did Judaize</hi> (as the originall hath it) that is, did turne to the <hi>Jewes</hi> Religion: and theſe <hi>[many]</hi> muſt needs be a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſeeing the Land which <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> reigned over, was divided into an hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces, in all which the <hi>Jewes</hi> inhabited, as the Letters ſent into theſe Provinces, by <hi>Haman</hi> for their deſtruction, and by <hi>Mordecai</hi> for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doe witneſſe: and it is not unlikely, that as in all theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the feare of the <hi>Jewes</hi> fell upon them, ſo in all theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſome were converted unto them. And in the very laſt dayes of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>the multitude which came together</hi> to heare <hi>the Apoſtles ſpeake with other tongues,</hi> were partly <hi>Jewes,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Proſelytes, Acts</hi> 2.10. And therefore doubtleſſe the number of the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> before Chriſts comming doth not come ſo much ſhort of the number of the <hi>Jewes</hi> converted ſince Chriſts
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113937:90"/>comming as you pretend: yea for ought that you or any man elſe can tell, they doe not onely equall but exceed the number of theſe <hi>Jewes.</hi> And laſtly, in ſaying [<hi>that the union of the two people, of the</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>conſiſts in the union of the Church under the Old and New Teſtament;</hi>] You doe herein grant, firſt, that the Church under the New Teſtament, is the Church of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and ſo not of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both, as it ſhould be, if it did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably conſiſt of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And ſecondly, you doe herein grant, that the Apoſtles words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. &amp;c. are meant of this union: for you cannot conceive, <hi>[that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the two people conſiſts in the union of the Church under the Old and New Teſtament:]</hi> unleſſe you doe conceive withall, that the places which ſpeake of their union are ſo to be underſtood. And thirdly, you doe herein contradict the preceding prophecies (which you grant to foreſhew the ſame uniting of the two people) for theſe Prophecies doe plainely declare the uniting of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> with all the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the earth: and not the uniting of <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Goſpel with <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Law; not the uniting I ſay, of one part of Chriſts myſticall bodie the Church then in heaven, with another part thereof newly cal'd to the Faith on earth.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon of my doubting in the former paſſage, is becauſe neither you, nor any other can give a reaſon ſufficient to prove, that the bringing of the <hi>Jewes</hi> for an offering unto the Lord out of all Nations, <hi>upon horſes, and in Litters, and in Charrets, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mules, and upon ſwift beaſts, &amp;c. to his mountaine at Jeruſalem,</hi> is not to be taken in a proper ſenſe for the beſt reaſon you can ſhew, is (as it ſeemes) <hi>that many thouſands have conceived theſe words in another ſenſe,</hi> which is as good a reaſon to prove that other ſenſe to be the true ſenſe of them, as it is to ſay; that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was no falſe Prophet, becauſe many millions have and doe erroneouſly conceive him to be a true Prophet. And why did you not afford us a ſight of that other ſenſe, which ſo many 1000. have taken theſe words in: and of the important reaſons, that mov'd them ſo to doe? ſeeing you confeſſe <hi>page</hi> 10. that the Scripture is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be taken, unleſſe the proper ſenſe be diſſonant from the ſcope of the text, or contrary to the analogie of Faith, or honeſty of manners: neither of which hath been prov'd of the proper ſenſe of theſe words; nor of any of the Prophecies upon which you ſtrive ſo much to impoſe a figurative ſenſe. And as you have not brought a reaſon to remove my doubting in this former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: ſo you have not prov'd, the reaſon of my doubting in the other, to be naught. For in ſaying, [<hi>that albeit the vaile be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from all the</hi> Jewes, <hi>and from all of all the Nations (in which ſenſe it ſhall never be taken away, &amp;c.) yet certainly it is taken away from the</hi> Jewes, <hi>and from all Nations, to wit, ſo many of them as turne to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>] In ſaying thus, you ſay nothing to the purpoſe: for was it not thus when the Prophet ſpake theſe words? was not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113937:91"/>the vaile then taken away from as many of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and of other Nations, as were then turn'd unto the Lord? And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Even unto this day, when</hi> Moſes <hi>is read, the vaile is upon their heart, nevertheleſſe when it ſhall returne unto the Lord, the vaile ſhall be taken away:</hi> were there not then more <hi>Jewes</hi> converted to the Chriſtian Faith, then have been ever ſince? and yet the Apoſtle ſaith, that the vaile was then upon their hearts, and ſpeaks of the removing of it from them, as of a thing to be done, and not then done; although thoſe were then converted which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be then converted. And therefore the Apoſtles words are to be underſtood of the removing of the vaile from all the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and not from ſome onely. And the Prophet ſaith likewiſe, <hi>that God will deſtroy the Covering caſt over all people, and the vaile that is ſpread over all Nations;</hi> which cannot be fulfill'd when onely a part of the vaile is deſtroy'd, as you underſtand it: but ſhall be, when the whole vaile is deſtroyed. And that it ſhall be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the Prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. which ſhewes, <hi>that all Nations ſhall goe up to the mountaine of the Lords houſe, to be taught in his wayes;</hi> and the ſame Prophets words, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> And the Prophecies which ſhew that all Nations ſhal goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, doe with the preceding Prophecie joyntly teſtifie: and therefore this firſt clauſe of your parentheſis doth flatly denie, what God doth frequently affirme. And the Scripture which you have alledg'd, is us'd onely as a daring glaſſe to dazzle the eyes of the heedleſſe or unlearned Reader, for that of <hi>Tit. chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. hath relation to the ſeverall ages, Sexes, and conditions of men, as the preceding verſes doe ſhew: ſo that <hi>[to all men]</hi> there, is no more then to all ſorts of men, young, and old, male and female, Maſter and ſervant.

                     <p>As in the preceding anſwer you have applied the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Zech.</hi> words, <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to the <hi>Jewes</hi> converted by St. <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Sermon: ſo in this you endeavour to parallel their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with the great and ſolemne mourning ſo largely expreſt in the following verſes of the ſame Prophecie. For it is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> the 11. <hi>There ſhall be a great mourning in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> ver. 12. <hi>The Land ſhall mourne, everie Familie apart, &amp;c.</hi> [<hi>whereby is intimated</hi> (ſay you) <hi>a diſtinction of the mourning in reſpect of place: and as they did mourne at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>publickly, ſo wee may eaſily conceive, that theſe who had reſorted at theſe publick Feasts unto</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:113937:94"/>mourne apart after their returning</hi>—<hi>(all facts that are very credible are not written.)</hi> And therefore on the contrary you have written here what is not credible. For is it credible that the mourning of 3000. is any way comparable to the ſolemne and univerſall mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25. to which the mourning in this Prophecie is compared? Or is it credible that any of theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> who reſorted unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of ſo many Countries as are rehearſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. were of the Families of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> when as the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> wat not then carryed into captivitie by the <hi>Romans?</hi> And if they mourned after their returne into their ſeverall Countries, into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia, Cappadocia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. this was out of the Land, whereas the mourning the Prophet foreſhewes is to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd onely in <hi>Leruſalem,</hi> and in the land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and it is to be obſerved by men and their wives apart, and what circumſtance is there in the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> from which you can gather, that any of the 3000. you ſpeake of, were women? yea it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by all the Families of the <hi>Jewes</hi> that remaine, that is, that are living at the accompliſhment of this Prophecie, and therefore the repentance of theſe 3000. could not poſſibly be the mourning here ſpoken of by the Prophet. You ſay next [<hi>that this Prophecit doth concerne the</hi> Jewes, <hi>and chiefly the perſons that crucified their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but not onely, ſeeing even the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And did you not tell us even now, <hi>[that you give no other interpretation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies then is chiefly intended?]</hi> How then can you ſay here, that this Prophecie is chiefly meant of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in a proper ſenſe; and yet meant alſo of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in a figurative ſenſe? is not this to give another ſenſe beſides that which is chiefly intended? and doe you thinke that both theſe ſenſes are intended? if ſo, how ſhall we know certainly which is chiefly intended? Surely to affirme that the Holy Ghoſt doth intend a double ſenſe in theſe Prophecies, is no ſmall errour; ſeeing it makes God to have, as it were a heart and a heart; to be I ſay, as a double dealer, who ſpeakes one thing and meanes another: and ſhall we conceit thus of God? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. <hi>Yea, let God be true and every man a lyar:</hi> as truth then is but one, ſo doubtleſſe there can be but one true ſenſe of any place in the Scripture, but one ſenſe intended by God; and thefore to make the Scripture <hi>Janus</hi>-like to looke two wayes, is from man and not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113937:94"/>from God, and it is the readieſt way that I know to foment diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt men. But there is yet the heavieſt charge behinde, for [<hi>it is great impudence,</hi> you ſay, <hi>to affirme that</hi> Zech. chap. 14. ver. 5. <hi>and</hi> 9. <hi>ſaith Chriſt ſhall deſcend unto the</hi> Jewes <hi>to reſtore their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for there is not one word of reſtoring or of the</hi> Jewes <hi>Kingdome in theſe two verſes.</hi>] And yet his deſcending and reigning over all the earth is expreſly foretold in theſe two verſes, and ſhall he come to be <hi>King over all the earth,</hi> and yet not reſtore the Kingdome of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> what City then ſhall be the royall Citie of this great King, if not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe extraordinarie reſtauration is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the verſes immediately following, and to which all the Nations ſhall goe up to worſhip, as the latter part of the chapter doth foreſhew? And what people ſhall be the choyceſt ſubjects of this great King, if not the Saints that ſhall come with him, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> (his brethren according to the fleſh) whom he ſhall then deliver from their enemies, as the judgement reveal'd in the 12, 13, 14, and 15. <hi>verſes</hi> doth declare? Certainly you muſt needs grant, that the Prophet hath here foretold the reſtoring of the <hi>Iewes</hi> (though he uſeth not theſe very words, which I ſay not) unleſſe you will denie that the 9. verſe is meant of our Saviours reigning on earth as man, and how can you doe this, when as the Prophet ſaith plainely, that our Saviour ſhall be King over all the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deſcending to the earth, and not while he is in Heaven? Thus then the great impudence of my innocent aſſertion, is nothing but the graceleſſe imprudence of your cholerick accuſation: and this one Prophecie which firſt ſhewes our Saviours comming with all the Saints, and then his reigning over all the earth, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove all your anſwers to the other part of the Treatiſe, to be (as the anſwers to this) but meere ſhifts, and evaſions.</p>

                     <p>As it is very untrue that you have had nothing from us of the felicity of the Nations in the day of the <hi>Jewes</hi> deliverance, for wee have brought you many unaccompliſhed prophecies out of Gods word to confirme it; ſo it is very true, that the reader hath had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from you of this felicity, ſeeing you have wholly conceal'd from him thoſe prophecies in which it is reveal'd. And theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing prophecies doe ſpeake of the reſtauration of the creatures both ſenſible and inſenſible at that time, for which purpoſe they were alledged, and not to ſhew the felicity of the Nations; which yet may well be gathered from the large mercy which God keepes in ſtore even for the dumbe and inſenſible creatures in that Day; in that day, I ſay, ſo frequently foretold by God, and not falſely imagined by us. But to prove that theſe prophecies doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the reſtoring of the ſenſible creatures to their primitive inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency at the redemption of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> you bring foure raw and trifling reaſons. For reciting the 10. <hi>verſe, In that day there ſhall be a roote of Ieſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an enſigne of the people, to him ſhall the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſeeke.</hi> You bid us, <hi>[Marke firſt, that he ſaith in that day, ſo he conjoynes the preceding and following things to the ſame time.]</hi> And wee ſay that the reſtoring of theſe creatures to their originall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; the comming in of the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and the redemption of the <hi>Iewes</hi> are all to be performed in that day. [<hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that he ſpeakes expreſſely of the calling of the Gentiles, as it is cited Rom.</hi> 15.12.] And wee ſay, that as ſome Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were for long agoe cal'd to the knowledge and obedience of the Goſpel; ſo at our Saviour's next appearing, all other Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be cal'd unto it. [<hi>Thirdly,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that in the</hi> 1. <hi>ver. he ſpeakes of the firſt comming of Chriſt, A rod ſhall come forth out of the ſtemme of Ieſſe, and a branch ſhall grow out of his rootes.</hi>] And this wee ſay too, and yet wee ſay with all, that as the foure verſes immediately following may as well, if not rather, be underſtood
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113937:96"/>of his actions at his ſecond comming, then at his firſt: ſo all that follows in the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.12, 13. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c. is to be fulfilled onely at his ſecond comming, which the firſt part of the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> ſpeakes of. And you may not thinke it ſtrange, that both the firſt and ſecond comming of our Saviour are revealed in the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wee finde them elſwhere revealed within the compaſſe of two or three <hi>verſes,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. and <hi>chap.</hi> 52.13, 14, 15. and in other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. Yea you doe ſeeme to me to acknowledge it, in that you forſake the 10. <hi>verſe</hi> (cut of which you gather your two former obſervations, and) in which the roote of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> is expreſſely menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and fall backe to the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> as the onely place in this <hi>chap.</hi> that ſhewes the firſt comming of our Saviour. And [fourthly, you ſay, <hi>that in the words following that teſtimony, he ſpeakes of the calling of the</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>together, as was exponed before.</hi>] And wee have before ſhewed this expoſition to be notoriouſly falſe: and that from the 11. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end of the <hi>chap.</hi> nought but the wonderfull redemption of the <hi>Jewes</hi> is foretold. As then you have not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the proper ſenſe of theſe prophecies; ſo doubtleſſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fit them with an allegoricall paraphraſe. For firſt, as here are many ſeverall kinds of beaſts mention'd, ſo you muſt finde out as many ſeverall degrees, or diſpoſitions of men to expound them by. And ſecondly, ſeeing in an allegoricall ſenſe theſe prophecies are apply'd to the converſion of men, you muſt tel us, why after their converſion ſome are cal'd, <hi>Wolves, Leopards, Lyons, Beares,</hi> and <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices:</hi> and others, <hi>Lambs, Kids, calves</hi> and <hi>oxen.</hi> I ſay after their converſion, for theſe names they are diſtinguiſhed by, when they are ſaid, <hi>to lie downe together, and to feed together, and to doe no hurt.</hi> And thirdly, you muſt give us the meaning of theſe phraſes. <hi>The ſucking childe ſhall play on the hole of the aſpe, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice den. The Lyon ſhall eate ſtraw like the Oxe. And duſt ſhall be the Serpents meate.</hi> And fourthly, ſeeing here is mention, not onely of irrationall creatures, but of rationall alſo; of mankind, as well as of beaſter, you muſt tel us firſt what Converts are alluded unto under the names of theſe ſeverall ſorts of beaſtes, and what Converts are meant by the <hi>little child,</hi> the <hi>ſucking child,</hi> and the <hi>weaned child:</hi> and ſecondly, why the names of theſe beaſtes are not to be taken properly for the beaſtes themſelves, whenas the things here rehearſt doe ſo well agree with them, and they are
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113937:96"/>plainely diſtinguiſhed from mankind too. And unleſſe you can give us reaſonable ſatisfaction in all this, you doe but vainely ſay, <hi>[that theſe words may be better exponed allegorically, then properly.]</hi> Yea the proper ſenſe of theſe Prophecies is further confirmed by the food which God created for every beaſt of the <hi>earth, and every fowle of the aire, and every thing that creepeth on the earth</hi> to live by, to wit, <hi>the green herb, Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. and by reſtraint of the wilde beaſts and fowles, both from their ravenous diſpoſition and feeding, the whole time of their being in the Arke: for ſeeing <hi>Noah</hi> was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide foode for them as well as for himſelfe and his Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. it muſt needs be granted, that as the <hi>Wolfe, the Lamb, and the Leopard; the cow, the Lyon and the Beare &amp;c. did then lie downe together,</hi> ſo they did feed together too: and that the <hi>Lyon did eate ſtraw, (or hay) like the Oxe:</hi> this, I ſay, muſt needs be granted, unleſſe we can imagine that <hi>Noah</hi> did take in fleſh into the Arke for the ravenous creatures to live by at that time.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:113937:99"/>the ſheepfold: as the verſes following doe declare, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters acknowledge: and albeit there hath been now and then one ſuch Wolfe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, that of a ſavage perſecutor, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a pious Saint, yet beſides all theſe Wolves, that have ſtill kept their owne hue and habit (and befides thoſe who being bred up in the Church, have ſtill retain'd their innocent garments) there have been many, who being without the Church, have exchang'd their habit for ſheeps clothing for no other end, but to have the benefit of the Sheeps paſture, and the better opportunitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſheepe, and to deſtroy the more ſheep.

And as I ſay not, that the change of beaſts affections from bad, to better, from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, to good, is to be the proper effect of any knowledge of God in themſelves; ſo I ſay, that God hath here reveal'd, that this change ſhall as well bee the effect of mans pleaſing him by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the change of them from better to worſe; from good to evill, was of mans diſpleaſing him by ſinne.</p>

And ſeeing you acknowledge the Renovation of the creature to be its delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we marvell what you meane in ſaying that <hi>[the Apoſtle is ſpeaking there of the finall deliverance of the creature:]</hi> For if you meane by <hi>[the finall deliverance]</hi> a further renovation of it; ſurely we know but of one renovation of the creature that the Scriptures ſpeake of, and that is to be a perfect renovation of it: but if you meane annihilation and diſſolution of it; you hold one more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the creature then any other Divine doth, to wit, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113937:100"/>by renovation, and a deliverance by abolition, but wee denie that the Apoſtle ſpeakes there of the diſſolution of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that this is cal'd a deliverance of the creature from the bondage of corruption in any place of the Scripture: Yea, wee ſee not how the creatures deliverance from the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be a delivering of it into a greater corruption; nor how the creature ſhould rather earneſtly expect ſuch a deliverance from the bondage of corruption, by which all the kinds of it ſhall be deſtroyed; then deſire to continue ſubject to this bondage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all the kinds are preſerved. And ſeeing the creatures bondage of corruption, is the vanitie to which it was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by reaſon of mans ſinne, after its creation; and ſo cannot be meant of that corruptible condition of the creature in which it was created ſubject to death and diſſolution; it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as wee conceive, that the creatures diſſolution cannot be its deliverance. For ſuch as the bondage is, ſuch muſt the deliverance be: but the bondage was the alteration which befell it through mans ſinne: after its creation (which was adventitious to it) and not its corruptibilitie, which was made naturall to it by creation: and conſequently the deliverance muſt be a reſtauration of it; the deliverance of the ſenſitive creatures a reſtauration from their hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and untamed diſpoſition to a mild and harmeleſſe, and of the inſenſitive, of the Starres and Heavens from a malignant influence to a favourable, and from a dimmer to a clearer brightneſſe, &amp;c. And whereas you ſay, [<hi>that the Author collecteth nothing particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that text, Iſaiah</hi> 65. <hi>ver.</hi> 25.] Surely he collects as much from that Prophecie, as from the other; and to this end hath alledged both together, becauſe both doe reveale the ſame thing: but if you want a particular obſervation from this text, you may take notice that he ſaith, <hi>And duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat,</hi> whereby he ſhewes, that when the <hi>Lyon ſhall eate ſtraw like the bullock,</hi> when all other beaſts and creeping things of the earth, and fowles of the aire, ſhall live by that food which was appointed for them at the creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. the Serpent onely ſhall feed ſtill on the nouriſhment of his curſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. as a memoriall of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtrument of mans fall, and ſo of ſubjecting his fellow-creatures into vanity thereby.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113937:101"/>theſe are the verſes immediately foregoing? <hi>And I will rejoyce in Jeruſalem, and joy in my people, and the voyce of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voyce of crying.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:113937:103"/>that the worde <hi>[everlaſting joy]</hi> cannot conſiſt <hi>with the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Nations at the expiration of the thouſand yeares;</hi> you doe but deceive your ſelfe with this reaſon. For though the thouſand yeares peacefull reigne ſhall be terminated, by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> inſurrection at the looſing againe of Satan: yet the joy of the <hi>Jewes</hi> (here reveal'd) is not limited by it. For we read indeed of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding of the Saints by the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. but we read not there of any feare in them, or hurt done unto them: yea wee read onely of the finall overthrow of their enemies. And whereas the better to countenance your Argument, you call the <hi>[everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting joy]</hi> here, a worldly joy; I pray what reaſon moves you to imagine that the joy promiſed by God to the converted <hi>Jewes</hi> (whom he calls his elect, and whom others, he ſaith, <hi>ſhall call the holy people, and the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed</hi>) ſhould rather be a worldly joy then ſuch a joy, as our Saviour promiſed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 22.

This reaſon then cannot prove your Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite to belong rather to the joy of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then to the joy of the Apoſtles; and yet unleſſe this be the reaſon of your calling it a worldly joy, I cannot conceive why you ſhould thinke, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Jewes</hi> are ſo plentifully inſpir'd with the Spirit of God, as the Prophets doe foreſhew they ſhall be, their joy ſhould not be as ſpirituall and inſeparable as the Apoſtles was. And although it be unqueſtionable from the paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that the Judgement of all evill as well Angels as men, is at the laſt reſurrection to be paſſed on them by the joynt-approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole number of the elect: yet ſeeing it is not unlikely, that by <hi>[the world] ver.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle meanes rather the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the time of Chriſts reigne on earth, then the number of the reprobate at the generall Judgement of the dead; it may juſtly be doubted, whether by the word <hi>[Saints]</hi> in that place alſo, the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> be not comprehended with the faithfull which our Saviour ſhall bring with him, as well as in the 20. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> where it is foreſhewed, that the Nations of the foure quarters of the earth ſhall be gathered together againſt

And as the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints ſhall be chiefe Judges under Chriſt, ſo wee may well thinke, that many of the unglorified Saints of the Jewiſh Nation ſhall be imployed by them in the adminiſtration of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing <hi>Iſaiah chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. ſaith plainly, that <hi>they ſhall take them captives whoſe captives they were, and ſhall rule over their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours.</hi> And ſuppoſe that none of the unglorified <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould be imployed in this government, yet when our Saviour himſelfe ſhall be King over all the earth, and all the Saints that come with him, Princes under him: when the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be his naturall Subjects, and all other Nations tributaries and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto them: when they ſhall be comprehended by the name of Saints, with thoſe undefiled ones that Chriſt ſhall bring with him: when all this ſhall be, what Nation ſhall the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be ſaid to be governed by, but by that which they live in ſubjection unto, and of whom their King came, and amongſt whom he ſhall reigne? And thus much touching your firſt pretence, that the <hi>Gentiles ſhall not be judged by the</hi> Jewes; <hi>becauſe the</hi> Jewes <hi>are to be judged by the Apoſtles.</hi> Which is all one as if you ſhould ſay, that a Nation that live under any government it ſelfe, cannot governe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:113937:104"/>other Nations that are in ſubjection unto it. Your next pretence is <hi>[that our Saviours words are not meant of the Apoſtles judging in a temporall Monarchy, ſeeing the Angels ſhall not be judged before the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Judgement.]</hi> But where doe you finde, that our Saviours promiſe to the Apoſtles, is not to be fulfill'd, before the judging of the Angels? And what ſhall we underſtand by <hi>[the twelve Tribes of Iſrael]</hi> according to your opinion? ſhall we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> take them for the reſt of the glorified Saints? no no, they cannot, for they ſhall be all Judges at the univerſall Judgement as well as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Shall we take them then for the reprobate of the Jewiſh Nation? Surely wee finde no ſuch ſignification of theſe words in all the Scripture, neither doe wee find it taught by any, that the reprobate of one Nation, ſhall be judged by ſome of the Saints onely, and the reprobate of another Nation, by others of the Saints: but that all the Saints ſhall joyntly judge all the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate both Angels and men, onely by aſſenting to the Judgement that our Saviour himſelfe ſhall give againſt them: and this may be gathered from the Apoſtle, who ſaith not thus, Know yee not that the Apoſtles, or Prophets: but, <hi>know yee not that we ſhall judge the Angels?</hi> he ſpeakes of all, and not of ſome Saints only: ſeeing then the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as you apply this ſaying to the univerſall Judgement, can neither be taken for the reſt of the glorified Saints, nor for the reprobate <hi>Jewes,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that you are out in your application, and conſequently, the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt be taken for the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> over which the Apoſtles ſhall ſit as Judges in the time of our Saviours reigne on earth. And how elſe ſhould this promiſe of our Saviour implie a priviledge to the Apoſtles above the reſt of the glorified Saints, for <hi>their following him in the time of his temptation,</hi> if it did not conſtitute them alone to be ſupreme Judges under him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that Nation which ſhall be neareſt and deareſt unto him in his Kingdome? for ſeeing all other Saints ſhall joyne with them in judging of the reprobate Angels, much more ſhall they in judging the reprobate <hi>Jewes,</hi> which cannot be ſo much honour unto the Diſciples, as the judging of the reprobate Angels: and ſo the great priviledge which our Saviour promiſed the Diſciples ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your opinion, be farre inferiour to that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes to be common to all the Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And firſt that the Reader may not take diſtaſte at us before he heare us, you tell him here <hi>that theſe ſew Millenaries agree not concerning the perſon of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:113937:106"/>their King: for Mr.</hi> Maton <hi>thinks that Chriſt ſhall continue viſible King of this Kingdome, and Mr.</hi> Archer <hi>thinkes that Chriſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Kingdome unto the</hi> Jewes, <hi>and returne unto the Heavens.</hi>] Herein indeed wee agree not, and as I heartily wiſh, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did ſo rightly underſtand the word of God, that there might be no difference at all amongſt them: ſo ſeeing offences muſt needs come, and that there muſt be hereſies and diviſions amongſt us, <hi>that they which are approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19.) I had rather differ from any man in opinion, then for any by reſpect to depart from one jot or title of the truth, which is either plainely reveal'd in the Scripture, or may be gathered from it by infallible conſequence. And ſure I am, that as wee find often mention of our Saviours comming againe, ſo <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. that <hi>his Redeemer ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth,</hi> to wit, at the day of his next appearing and the Saints reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as theſe words immediately following doe declare, <hi>And though after my skinne, wormes deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, &amp;c.</hi> And St. <hi>Luke, ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 31, records, that <hi>the Lord ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father David:</hi> and <hi>Jer. chap.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>that he ſhall reigne and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgement and Juſtice in the earth;</hi> and ſo ſay <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Zechary;</hi> (yea and we conceive it to be for this reaſon, eſpecially, that <hi>Judea</hi> is cal'd the <hi>Land of Immanuel, Iſaiah</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) and we reade not of his departure from the earth againe, untill the earth it ſelfe ſhall paſſe away at the laſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Wee muſt not beleeve our election or Juſtification, becauſe Divines doe differ about the materiall and formall canſes of the one, and the moving and meriting cauſes of the other: and becauſe there is a difference betwixt you and us about the manner and place of our Saviours Kingdome, we muſt not believe that he hath any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yea, we muſt quite caſt off the worſhip of God, becauſe we cannot agree about the forme of it, ſome being for a ſet forme and others againſt it; ſome againe for premeditated, and others for extemporary prayers.

                     <p>What a miſcellany of untruth and contradiction is here? we need not then enquire what ſpirit had the guidance of your pen. It is evident enough, that it was he, who once undertooke to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:113937:109"/>be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets. For that Chriſt is a King, it is unqueſtionable: <hi>Where is he that is borne King of the Jewes?</hi> ſaid the wiſe men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke</hi> have given us his regall genealogy, have regiſtred his princely parentage. At his birth then he was a King autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative, as Divines ſpeake. The Authority of a King did then of right belong unto him: but he was not then, nor hath been ſince, a King <hi>executive,</hi> by putting his royall Authority in execution, Neither have I ſaid it, but the contrary, for my words are <hi>[but— conſidering this we may juſtly doubt, whether he hath as yet executed the office of a King,]</hi> yea that our Saviour as man, as the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> hath not yet executed the office of a King, is the very hinge of the difference we are now entring upon; for you hold that our Saviours reigning as the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> is to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led while he is in heaven, where and when he was not to reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and we hold, that his reigning as man, as the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> is to be fulfilled on earth, at his next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, when and where he is to reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> In this then, is our diſagreement, and not our agreement, as you report. And ſeeing you affirme [<hi>that he hath executed his Kingly office,</hi> for you ſay, (though falſely) in all which we agree] How can you conceive, that he doth now reigne? when as that which is already done, cannot poſſibly be as yet in doing, or to doing. It ſeemes by this therefore that you neither rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what we, nor what your owne ſide doe hold of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Kingdome: and yet as I take it, you are the man, that uttered this ſelfe-conceited query, [<hi>Whether doe they underſtand the differences betwixt Jewes and Chriſtians?</hi> pag. 1.] This is one untruth, to wit, <hi>[That I have granted, that Chriſt hath executed his Kingly office,]</hi> The next is, <hi>[That I have ſaid, that he ſits on a Throne in heaven as man]</hi> which though it be in it ſelfe a truth: for Chriſt himſelfe ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>and am ſet downe with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Throne, Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Yet it is not true, that I have ſaid theſe words; for thus I have ſaid, <hi>[that the place where he now ſits is the Fathers Throne, a Throne in which he hath no proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but as God.]</hi> Theſe are your miſreports of what I have idſa to which we may adde, your affirming that it hath not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Prophets have ſpoken of a Kingdome on earth;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:113937:110"/>when as the Prophecies which I have alledged for it, are ſo plaine, that you left them, as one afraid to behold their evidence.

But you have ſaid, <hi>[that Chriſt both ſits, and ſits not there, in a logicall acception, and that he ſits there as God-man, and yet not as man.]</hi> Thus contrary are you to your ſelfe, and withall as contrary to the truth in miſapplying your diſtinction. For whereas you ſay <hi>[It may be granted, that Chriſt ſits on a throne in heaven as man, if theſe words be underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the logicall acceptation of them]</hi> it is notoriouſly falſe: for the words <hi>[as man]</hi> in this ſenſe doe imply ſomewhat eſſentially belonging unto man which cannot be affirmed of Chriſts fitting on a Throne in heaven, to wit, that it doth eſſentially belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his humane nature; for then it ſhould inſeparately belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and to all other men beſides; this then you ſhould have deny'd, and affirm'd onely that he ſits there, as ſuch a man as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. Put you, out of your great skill in Logique, (in which you will allow me no inſight) have firſt affirmed both members
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113937:110"/>of your diſtinction, and preſently deny'd both: ſuch a ſubtile or rather ſimple diſcourſe have you extracted out of your logicall principle. And that the Reader may ſee how unſeaſonable and unreaſonable you have alledged this Philoſophicall rule, as well as the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall writings and revelations, he muſt know; that this maxime, <hi>[what agreeth unto any man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore it followes not, that what belongs unto Chriſt as man, belongs unto all men: becauſe we uſually ſay, that all that belongs to Chriſt, as man; which belongs not to him as God; which appertaines to his humane, and not unto his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whether it be proper to him as man, in oppoſition to other creatures, as to laugh, and to be borne of a woman, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon alſo to other creatures, as to be hungry, and thirſty, to eate and drinke, to walke, to weepe, to groane, &amp;c.

Theſe and ſuch like we ſay, doe not in propriety of ſpeech, belong unto Chriſt as God, but as man becauſe they are the properties of his humane nature.

All then that the Apoſtle affirmes in this text likewiſe to be already done is this, That Chriſt is ſate downe at the right hand of God, as was foretold; but as for the other part of this prophecy, he ſaith plainely, That Chriſt now expects onely when it ſhall be fulfilled; and if this be not ſufficient to make you confeſſe, that the enemies which <hi>David</hi> here prophecied of, are not yet made ſubject unto Chriſt; that which follows in the Pſalme will put it beyond exception, for he nominates what enemies are here meant, the time when, and the manner how they are to be made Chriſt's footſtoole. The enemies he ſpeakes of, are men, the Kings and Heads of the earth, as we finde <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. The time when, is <hi>[the day of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.]</hi> The day in which the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be as willing to receive him, as in the day of his poverty they were to be rid of him; as we learne <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the dry of they power.</hi> The manner how, is by an eminent deſtruction brought on theſe Kings, and their forces, as the 5 and 6. <hi>verſes</hi> doe informe us alſo: which being compared with the latter part of the 19. <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revel.</hi> doe plainely ſhew that this deſtruction which <hi>David</hi> foretels, is the very ſame with that which Saint <hi>John</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:113937:114"/>there reveales: for that is to be effected at our Saviours deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from heaven, and ſo is this; for it is to be at his comming againe from the right hand of the Father. And therefore here is a good ground too for another Throne, and that a Throne on earth. And your anſwer to this text is a meere contradicting of it; for whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt being ſate downe at the right hand of God, expects till his enemies be made his footſtoole.</hi> You ſay plainely, <hi>[that his enemies are made ſubject unto him, even his greateſt enemies.]</hi> And for want of ſcripture to juſtifie this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, you ſubjoyne, <hi>[as it is granted before,]</hi> and ſo father it on me. But you ſhew not where it is granted, neither can I imagine what you meane by it, unleſſe you meane that it is granted by my alledging of the ſame Apoſtles words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. to wit, That Chriſt having (by his paſſion) <hi>ſpoiled principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in himſelfe.</hi> But ſurely though it may be true, That Chriſt after the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the worke of our Redemption on the croſſe, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over the evill ſpirits in his owne perſon, making a ſhew of them openly, that is, leading them captives in the time of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; (as ſome expoſitours underſtand it) yet it is not true, that theſe principalities are the enemies recorded in the 110. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tooke the foreſaid text. Neither is it true, that the evill Angels were then held in a continued ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Chriſt, for the ſpace of a 1000. yeares (as they ſhall be in the time of his reigne on earth, when he caſts them into the bottomleſſe pit, when he ſhuts them up from deceiving the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is foretold <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.2, 3.) For as before Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Satan</hi> could no more deceive the elect, then he can ſince; ſo hee hath been no more ſtraitened of his liberty in walking up and downe in the earth, nor of his power in tempting men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, ſince Chriſts triumphing over him in his owne perſon; then he was before, (if he hath ſo much) for it is of the time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell that it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Woe to the Inhabitants of the earth, and of the ſea, for the devill is come downe unto you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> 'Tis of this time, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our Adverſary the Devill, as a roaring lion walketh about ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> 1. <hi>Ep. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And 'tis that we may be able to ſtand againſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:113937:115"/>the wiles of this enemy, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us, <hi>to put on the while armour of God, Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea it is in the Chriſtian Church, that ſome were to give heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and that there ſhould be <hi>falſe teachers who privily ſhould bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them.</hi> As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writes, 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> &amp;c.

Doubtleſſe Satan cannot be held in ſubjection, to be bound up, (as he muſt be in the time of Chriſt a reigne) as long as new enemies doe ariſe againſt Chriſt, in his poore members, ſeeing it is onely through the liberty and power that this Arch-makebate hath in the world, that good men ſuffer for the truth, and evill men oppoſe it; that I ſay, men are kept from a generall peace and unity over the whole earth. And therefore in confeſſing, <hi>[that new enemies ſtill ariſe againſt Chriſt]</hi> you doe Italy gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, what you before falſly affirmed, to wit, that the evill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Chriſts greateſt enemies are now held in ſubjection by him that they are now deprived both of their power and liberty to doe, hurt, to rebell againſt Chriſt, and to raiſe perſecution againſt thoſe that are Chriſts; as they ſhall be, I ſay not in this time of the world, but in that in which Chriſt ſhall reigne perſonally on earth. Yea if Chriſts enemies mentioned in the foreſaid Pſalme, be now made his footſtoole, if they be now wholly ſubdued unto him, (for this is the meaning of <hi>their being made his footſtoole</hi>) how can new ones ſtill ariſe?</p>

                     <p>It doth ill become a deceive to cry out againſt deceit. Our Saviours words <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. are very plaine, they are no para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I grant to ſit with mee in my Throne,</hi> (loe here a Throne in which the Saints ſhall ſit with Chriſt, it follows) <hi>Even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet downe with my Father in his Throne.</hi> (Loe here a Throne in which no man can ſit but himſelfe,) and therefore here are two diſtinct Thrones.

That text <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>[ſpeakes not, you ſay, of a proper King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, but of the Kingdome of our Lord and his Chriſt]</hi> And by this reckoning our Saviour hath no proper Kingdome at all, and conſequently is not properly a King: for what Kingdome belongs to Chriſt, which may not as well be called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord, as the Kingdom of his Chriſt? But certainly the Kingdom which this text ſaith ſhall become the Kingdomes of Chriſt, are the Kingdomes of this world: and therefore King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes on earth, and proper Kingdomes, both which you deny. And they are to become Chriſts Kingdomes at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, and not before, that is, at the time of his appearing againe: and therefore they are to be his to governe as he is man; and ſo by your owne confeſſion, to be properly his. Although then we grant, that theſe words, <hi>[the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, doe intimate a diſtinction of perſons, and unity of power,]</hi> which is more then <hi>Pareus</hi> grants, (who enclines to a diſtinction of natures, and unity of perſons,) yet it will not follow from hence, that the Kingdomes of this world,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:113937:118"/>which our Saviour at his comming ſhall receive into his owne poſſeſſion, as he is man, ſhall not be his proper Kingdomes. For they are ſaid <hi>to become the Kingdomes of our Lord,</hi> not becauſe they are not now his: but firſt becauſe at the accompliſhed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and actuall ſubjection of them unto Chriſt, God ſhall more marvellouſly declare his ſupreame power over them, then ever he did. And ſecondly, becauſe they ſhall then be his after a more ſpeciall manner, then they are now his; becauſe I ſay, he ſhall then be worſhipped and obeyed in them all, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the righteous rule of his owne Lawes. And yet they are ſaid to become the Kingdomes of Chriſt onely, in regard of the adminiſtration, of the immediate government of them. For Chriſt alone ſhall then be viſible King over them, as now others are: and therefore ſhall be as properly a King on earth, as any of them who now beare rule in theſe Kingdomes. And this the next words of the text doe confirme, which ſay not, <hi>and they,</hi> but <hi>and he,</hi> (that is Chriſt <hi>alone</hi>) <hi>ſhall reigne for ever and ever.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that text <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26. is very pertinently cited, for proofe of that thing which ſhall be on earth, and is not now in heaven. For our Saviour (though then in heaven) did not ſay, that he had given the Saints in heaven, or Saints on earth, power over the Nations on earth, but that he would give them power over them. And ſurely we cannot thinke, that the Martyrs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10. would call on God to haſten the time for the avenging of their bloud, on them that dwell on the earth: if they could now do it themſelves, if they could now rule the Nations with <hi>a rod of iron, &amp; break them to ſhivers, as a Potters veſſell.</hi> Yea, why have the Saints on earth been ſo long time perſecuted, afflicted, tormented, and ſtill are, if the Saints in heaven have power to deliver them, and tread down their enemies? And why are there ſtill ſo many large heathen Kingdomes, not yet ſubdued to the faith, or government of the faithfull, if the Saints in heaven can rule them as they pleaſe? Certainely if you can make this good, that our Saviour hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given to the Saints in heaven, that power over the Nations which he here ſpeakes of, to wit, a conquering and commanding power, a power to rule them with <hi>a rod of iron:</hi> you will helpe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to a better ground for their ſupplication unto Saints, then was ever yet thought of by themſelves. For doubtleſſe if
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:113937:118"/>the Saints in heaven have now command over this inferiour world, they muſt needes be acquainted with all paſſages of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in it, as Kings and their Agents are with the affaires of State in the Kingdomes over which they rule: and ſo may wel be ſought to, if nor for ſpirituall, yet for outward and temporall advice, ſuccour, and defence.</p>

Certainely unrighteous Judges are a ready meanes to make a Kingdome unrighteous: to make charity waxe cold, and envy and contention grow hot. But upright Judges are as effectuall a meanes to preſerve righteouſneſſe in a Kingdome, to cheriſh and ſtrengthen love and unity, and to chaſe away all hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention: and how righteous then ſhall that Kingdome be, where our Saviour himſelfe ſhall be King; and the Diſciples and other Saints governours under him? And ſurely ſeeing the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſael</hi> cannot be taken for the reprobate, nor for the Saints already departed, and to depart, or to overcome before our Saviours appearing, (for theſe muſt be Judges, as well as the

But I deny that they have any reſemblance with the civill affaires of an earthly Kingdome, or that there is any compariſon to be made betwixt them and our Saviours ſaying, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28. ſo that the impudence you ſpeake of may well recoile on your ſelfe. For the text <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. ſhews onely, that the fulneſſe of alljoy and delight, is in the enjoyment of the ſight of God, and to be <hi>[at the right hand of God]</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token the higheſt place of honour and glory in heaven, which is proper to our Saviour, who is ſaid to ſit <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi> in alluſion to a cuſtome amongſt men, who are wont to ſet thoſe whom they will moſt honour, whom they moſt delight in, at their right hands. And that Text <hi>Pſa.</hi> 17.8. ſhews that <hi>David</hi> after the reſurrection, when he ſhall have a glorified body, as Chriſt now hath, ſhall be perfectly happy, ſhall be as he would be. For theſe words <hi>[to awake after thy likeneſſe,]</hi> are all one with thoſe of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44. <hi>To riſe in incorruption, in glory, in power, to riſe with a ſpirituall body. For if we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the likeneſſe of Chriſts death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. and becauſe we are laid into our graves as one that lies downe in his bed to ſleepe, and ſhall be raiſed out of them, as one that riſeth out of his bed from ſleepe, therefore it is, that the Prophet uſeth, <hi>[awake]</hi> in ſtead of <hi>[ariſe]</hi> And the text <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. is referred by <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to Gods bountifull proviſion in this life for all men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; and by <hi>Calvine</hi> better, as well to the outward and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, as to the ſpirituall and eternall benefits of God towards the faithfull, his words are, <hi>Some reſtraine it to ſpirituall graces, but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:113937:122"/>unto mee it ſeemeth a more likelyhood, that under it are comprehended all Gods benefits, that pertaine as well to the uſe of this preſent life, as to the eternall &amp; heavenly bleſſedneſſe.</hi> And ſo refers it as well to joyes on earth, as to joyes in heaven. And happily ſeeing the Prophet makes mention here of the houſe of God, it is beſt underſtood of the great comfort which men ſhall receive through Gods loving kindneſſe towards them, in the time of our Saviours Kingdome on earth, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple of the Lord ſhall again be rebuilt, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it, as it is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.2. or as it is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16. <hi>ſhall goe up from yeare to yeare to worſhippe the King the Lord of Hoſts, and to keepe the feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> When I ſay, <hi>in the mountaine of the Lords houſe,</hi> in the reſtored <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Lord of Hoſts ſhall make unto all people a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined; And ſhall deſtroy the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vaile that is ſpread over all Nations, Iſai.</hi> 25.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beſides, every underſtanding man knowes, that <hi>[to drinke of the river of thy pleaſures]</hi> is a metaphoricall expreſſion, ſeeing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not the nouriſhment of the body, and ſo properly, and corporally dranke of; but belonging to the ſoule, to which they are as comfortable, as ſweete and wholeſome waters to a thirſty body. <hi>But to drinke wine, to eate the Paſseover, to eate and drinke at our Saviours table, to eate bread in the Kingdome of God, to ſit on ſeates, and judge the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, are all proper expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo quite different from the other. And as ſpirituall pleaſures appertaine to the Saints on earth, as well as to the Saints in heaven; ſo doe eating and drinking agree as well with glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as unglorified bodies, as well with the ſtate of immortality, as with the ſtate of mortality. For our Saviour did eate on earth, (at his Diſciples table) after his reſurrection; and he ſaith, that the glorified Saints ſhall eate and drinke with him at his table, after their reſurrection. And further he ſaith, that after the laſt Judgement, there is in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the fruit of the tree of life, to be eate of; and the water of the river of life to be dranke of; his words are, <hi>To him that over cometh will I give to eate of the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, Rev.</hi> 2.7. and againe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14, 15. <hi>Bleſſed are they that doe his Commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life. And whoſoever will, let him take
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:113937:122"/>of the water of life freely.</hi> And indeed ſeeing God creates nothing in vaine, it were vaine to thinke, that the tree of life ſhould beare twelve manner of fruites monthly, unleſſe they were to be fed on: or that the river of the water of life ſhould runne through the midſt of the ſtreete in the holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if it were not as well to be dranke of by the Saints in glory, as to nouriſh the tree of life on the ſides of it. And therefore unleſſe you can bring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofes to ſhew that I am miſinformed, or doe miſinforme, then theſe texts of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> or any you have cited hitherto, you your ſelfe will be found an over-haſty miſinformer againſt the truth.</p>

So that the Apoſtle diſcourſing here of a proper and bodily reſurrection, ſpeakes onely of ſuch a death, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, (which is a bodily death,) and ſuch a reſurrection as is common to all; (which is a bodily reſurrection.) And having proved the reſurrection, and ſhewed alſo in what order it ſhall be fulfilled: towards the end of the <hi>chapter,</hi> he tells the Saints with what bodies they themſelves ſhall ariſe, to wit, with incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, with glorified, with ſpirituall bodies. And as for the text, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17. it doth ſhew onely that the Saints which are living, at our Saviours comming, ſhall not be caught up to meete Chriſt, before thoſe that are dead. For when the Saints who are dead, ſhall be raiſed out of their grayes, then the Saints that remaine alive ſhall together with them be caught up into the cloudes to meete the Lord. So that this order, (as you call it) is an order betwixt the Saints remaining alive at our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the Saints deceaſed before his comming: and not an order touching the diſtinct riſing of all thoſe that are dead, which is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. &amp;c. And whereas you would make it a matter incredible, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the Saints ſhall come downe againe, from the aire, to abide ſo long ſpace on earth, onely becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>[That they ſhall meete the Lord in the aire, and ſo ſhall ever be with the Lord.]</hi> You doe ſhew your ſelfe to be either very forgetfull of what you have read in Gods word, or that you tooke but little notice of it, when you did read it; For doth not <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.5. tell us, <hi>That the Lord ſhall come and all the Saints with him?</hi> Seeing then the Saints ſhall meete the Lord in the aire, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: and ſeeing alſo when they are met, the Lord ſhall come, and all the Saints with him, as the Prophet ſaith, whither ſhall they come, but from the aire to the earth?

For ſeeing the Apoſtle without any relation to the ſeverall eſtates of the juſt and unjuſt, after their reſurrection, ſpeakes here onely of the riſing of their bodies, which equally and univocally belongs to them all; why ſhould we thinke, that he would not as well have mentioned the reſurrection of the juſt, if they were to riſe at the ſame time with theſe? if the words <hi>[But every man in his owne order]</hi> doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate any order? doe not intimate a priority of time betwixt the godly and ungodly, as well as they doe betwixt Chriſt and them?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you were as able to juſtifie your accuſations, as you are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:113937:125"/>forward to accuſe, there were no contending with you; but it is ſo common with you to awe the Reader with great words, when you have leaſt to ſay to the purpoſe, that he is by this time well acquainted with your craft, and therefore your bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that here is a contradiction, will be taken for no evidence. Although then the word <hi>[commeth]</hi> be not expreſſed in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, yet to make the ſenſe compleate, this word, or a word equivalent to this, (as your owne tranſlation doth witneſſe) is here to be underſtood. For then, [or at that time, ſay you, is the end.] I pray at what time? at the time of our Saviours deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? ſurely the Apoſtle anſwers not ſo: <hi>but when he ſhall have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father: When he ſhall have put downe all rule, and all authority, and power, &amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>[Then]</hi> here is referred by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to theſe <hi>[Whens]</hi> which follow it, and not to the words foregoing, as you wreſt it. And beſides whereas the Apoſtle ſhews us, when the end ſhall be by theſe convertible expreſſions, <hi>When he ſhall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to God: When he ſhall have put downe all rule, and all authority, and power:</hi> you skippe from this, and falſely and fallaciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, <hi>[That the time when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdome, is, when they who are Chriſts ſhall riſe at his comming:]</hi> ſo that according to your explication of the text, the words, <hi>[Then commeth the end]</hi> are ſuperfluous, and the text ſhould runne thus, <hi>Chriſt the firſt-fruites afterwards they that are Chriſt's at his comming, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> And thus it appeares, how much this place of the Apoſtle doth puzzle you. And yet you tell us alſo, [That the 15 <hi>ver.</hi> doth teach us <hi>that Chriſt reigneth now, becauſe it is ſaid there, for be muſt reigne, &amp;c.]</hi> But this is no truer then the reſt that you have ſaid. For the Apoſtle referres theſe words to the time after his comming, and not to the time that now is; ſo that the full meaning of his words, is this. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they that are Chriſts at his comming, Then commeth the end, when (after his comming) he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to God; When</hi> (after his comming) <hi>he ſhall have put downe all rule, and all authority, and power; When</hi> (after his comming) the reſt of the dead are riſen. <hi>For he muſt reigne</hi> (after his comming) <hi>till he hath put all his enemies under his feete: And the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</hi> at the laſt reſurrection of the dead. And whereas
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:113937:125"/>you adde that text <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. <hi>[Thou haſt put all things under his feete, to prove alſo that Chriſt doth now reigne;]</hi> You doe very unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly contradict your owne Tenet, and the Apoſtles words. For if all things are now actually put under him, then he doth not now reigne, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That he muſt reigne untill he hath put all his enemies under his feete,</hi> and no longer. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident that thoſe words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. are ſpoke in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods fore-appointment of it, and not to the actuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it: to Gods committing of that power to the Sonne by which he is now <hi>able to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe,</hi> as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. and not to the Sunnes putting of this power in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which ſhall not be till his comming againe, as both the order and ſenſe of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words here doe ſhew; and the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in heaven at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. And the thankſgiving of the Elders, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. doe confirme. And ſo the beginning and not the end of the adminiſtration of Chriſts Kingdome is to be when they who are dead in Chriſt, ſhall be made alive. And though theſe Saints ſhall dye no more, yet death the laſt enemy ſhall not be then utterly deſtroyed, for as much as none but theſe Saints ſhall then riſe: and that the <hi>Jewes</hi> which are then to be delivered, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which ſhall be called at and through their deliverance, and thoſe who are borne in the time of our Saviours reigne, ſhall be ſubject unto death as well as we, though not to the like perſecution by men, or temptation from Satan, who is then to be bound up for the ſpace of a 1000 yeares.</p>

For if you ſhould have denyed, that the bodies of the Saints muſt reigne as well as their ſoules, you could ſhew no reaſon for it. And if you ſhould have granted it, you had herein denyed your owne Tenet, to wit, that the Saints do now reigne, becauſe while they are in this life, they ſuffer in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all manner of diſtreſſe, they are hungry, thirſty, naked, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, buffeted, baniſhed, tormented: and when their ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life, their bodies are left behind to moulder into duſt.

And becauſe the clearing of this point, may ſerve for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole matter, I adde by way of explanation. As the ſinne of</hi> Adam <hi>was committed againſt God the Father, &amp; his revolting or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie was a diminution of the Fathers Kingdome, ſo the bringing of the faithfull into his obedience, is the rendring of that Kingdome. It is true, the offence was againſt the Sonne, and Holy Spirit: but the worke of the creation, being the worke of the Father in a ſpeciall manner, (as it is intimated in the Creede) the ſinne was directly against the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When obedience was not given, the Father might have executed his juſtice on the offenders, as he did on the Angels. Now as when a part of an earthly Kingdome rebelleth againſt the King directly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly againſt his Sonne, as a friend, and heir of his Fathers Crowne: the Sonne may undertake to regaine the rebels unto his Father, and the Father may be well pleaſed to commit unto his Sonne that part of the Kingdome for that effect with full power, which the Sonne accepts, and reigneth, and prevailes powerfully: ſo that, albeit, the arch-traitour gain-ſtand in malice to the honour of the Ring, and his Sonne, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the rebels are reconciled with the King, who by this meanes regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Kingdome: So the Sonne of God hath undertaken for ſo many as it pleaſed him, and beſeecheth men to be reconciled with the King of heaven and earth, ſhewing that he hath appeaſed the Fathers wrath, and hath power to receive into, and exclude from the Kingdome of heaven: which power he hath received of the Father; and he ſhewes that there is a time determined for receiving men into grace againe; So that if that time ſhall expire, there is no more grace to be ſhewed unto any;</hi> Satan <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth the glory of God, and mans reconciliation, and therefore oppoſeth
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:113937:128"/>by deceiving ſome, and vexing others, who hearken unto the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: nevertheleſſe Chriſt prevaileth by his preaching, ſo that a great many repent, and crave mercy, and others not: when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined time comes, theſe who have been received into mercy, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto God the Father, and as if they had not rebelled, he accepts them into his Kingdome: when the Sonne ſaith, Here am I, and theſe whom I have brought into acknowledgement of their offences: I have ſatisfied juſtice for them, Thou O Father haſt thine owne Subjects, and let them have the Kingdome prepared for them: The Father will not ſay, thy reward is not in heaven, but on earth: therefore let them goe againe to the earth, and inherit glory there for a <hi>1000</hi> yeares: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them into the inheritance reſerved for them in the heavens.</hi>

                     <p>This anſwer is as much beſides the queſtion as the other: for the argument is, That if Chriſt doth now reigne, and ſhall reigne onely till his comming, then thoſe Saints which ſhall be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at his comming ſhall be exempted from his Kingdome, ſhall not reigne with him, as the Saints departed did reigne with him. To which you ſay no more but this, <hi>[That they ſhall be caught up to meete him.]</hi> And beſides, ſeeing our Saviour is not to give up his Kingdome to his Father, till after his next appearing, and that the time of his reign is to be but a 1000 yeares; it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (according to your opinion) that not onely all the Saints before his incarnation, but that the Apoſtles themſelves too, and all the reſt of the Saints that have been converted within the firſt ſix hundred yeares and upwards ſince his incarnation, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from his Kingdome. And yet doubtleſſe both the Saints before Chriſts firſt comming, and the Saints under the firſt ages of the Goſpell, have all reigned ſpiritually, as well as the Saints ſince that time. They have been conquerours I ſay, over ſin, and over ſufferings for obedience unto Chriſt, in as eminent manner, as any Saints ſince have been, (if not more eminently,) as in the 11 <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Heb.</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall hiſtories doe teſtifie. And therefore that reigne of the Saints revealed in the 20 <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> as a reigne to come, and to be but of a 1000 yeares continuance, muſt needs be meant of ſome other reigne: and conſequently of a proper and politick reigne on earth, at the redemption of their bodies. But leſt the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:113937:128"/>reader ſhould take notice that you have nothing to ſay to theſe arguments, you annexe unto your indirect anſwer, a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; whereof that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> is the whole ſumme. And in this diſcourſe which you call <hi>[a clearing of the whole matter.]</hi> There are theſe notable paſſages. For firſt you rell us, <hi>[that Adams revolting was a diminution of the Fathers Kingdome.]</hi> whereas indeed it made way for the ſalvation of thoſe whom God had predeſtinated unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, of which number not one was diminiſhed by <hi>Adams</hi> apoſtaſie: for as many as God had purpoſed to ſave before mans fall, ſo many and no more will he make heires with Chriſt, will he make partakers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for them from the beginning of the world. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you tell us, <hi>[That the bringing of the faithfull into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Father, is the rendring of the Kingdome unto him.]</hi> And ſo you make Chriſts reigne, and the rendring of his Kingdome to the Father, to be all one, and to contemporate; whereas the giving up of his Kingdome, muſt needes ſucceede the time of his reigne: for to ceaſe from governing a Kingdome, muſt needes preſuppoſe a preceding government of it. Yea and you your ſelfe ſay afterwards, <hi>[That when the determined time comes, theſe who have beene received into mercy, are preſented unto God the Father— when the Sonne ſaith, Here I am, and theſe whom I have brought into the acknowledgment of their offences, I have ſatisfied juſtice for them, Thou O Father haſt thine owne Subjects, and let them have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for them.]</hi> Wherein you plainely acknowledge, that the rendring up of the Kingdome to the Father, is to be when the number of the elect is fulfilled, when theſe <hi>who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been received into mercy, are all preſented unto God the Father,</hi> with ſpotleſſe and incorruptible bodies and ſoules. Which is a flat contradicting of your former words, to wit, <hi>That the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the faithfull into mercy, that the bringing of them into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obedience at their converſion, is the rendring of Chriſts Kingdome.</hi> Thirdly, you tell us, <hi>[That Adams revolting was a ſinne directly againſt the Father.]</hi> Whereas the workes of power being chiefly attributed unto the Father, the workes of wiſedome unto the Sonne, and of love unto the Holy Ghoſt; The ſinnes of infirmity,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:113937:129"/>and weakeneſſe are moſt direct againſt the firſt Perſon: the ſinnes of ignorance and unadviſedneſſe moſt direct againſt the ſecond Perſon: and the ſinnes of wilfulneſſe and malice, moſt direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the third Perſon. And did <hi>Adam</hi> fall out of weakeneſſe, when (as all Divines agree) he had ability to ſtand? or out of ignorance, when he knew that he did what he was forbid to doe? or rather out of wilfulneſſe, when notwithſtanding his power to have withſtood temptation, and his knowledge of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the act; he yet yeelded to doe what he ſhould noth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, from this defective compariſon, you make Chriſt to reigne but over a part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdome; whereas he is to deliver up a whole Kingdom to the Father, and not a part of a Kingdome onely; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he muſt reign over al that he delivers up. Yea although you here make Chriſt to reign only over a part of his Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſay alſo, <hi>[That the areh-traytour gain-ſtands in malice to the honour of the King and his Sonne: that Satan ſtill oppoſeth by deceiving ſome, and vexing others:]</hi> yet you ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>That Chriſt is great over all the world, ſeeing all the Gentiles doe prayſe him, and all people land him.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 52. <hi>That he hath made all Kingdomes of the world acknowledge his authority, and hath put downe all contrary power and authority, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 58. <hi>That now is no Kingdome but our Lords and his Chriſts.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 40. <hi>That his enemies are made ſubject to him, even his greateſt enemies.</hi> So contrary are you to the truth, and to your ſelfe. Sixthly and laſtly, you tell us, [<hi>That at the delivering up of our Saviours Kingdome, the Father will not ſay, Thy reward is not in heaven, therefore let them goe againe into the earth, and inherit glory for a</hi> 1000 <hi>yeares.</hi>] And doubtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And we ſay, that his Kingdome is to beginne at his appearing, when none but the Saints then departed ſhall riſe: and not at the laſt judgement, when all others ſhall riſe, as you to delude the reader doe purpoſely miſunderſtand us.

                           <hi>I am ſure, no man can imagine that theſe words in themſelves import, that our Saviour ſhall reigne among the</hi> Jewes <hi>as an earthly Monarch: which is the point.</hi> pag. 45. <hi>And therefore this, if by the time, &amp;c. is as if one would ſay, If I be a King, I am a King.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Prophets have another meaning, may be ſeen by all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and partly by that is ſaid here.</hi> 3. <hi>It is wonder, if any</hi> Jew <hi>will ſay, that the Prophets ſpeake of nothing more; for if his meaning be, They ſpeake not more of any other thing, it is queſtionable, ſeeing there is much ſpoken of Gods precepts: But if he doe meane, (as it ſeemes) that they ſpeake not of any other thing that can be applyed unto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours comming, I will cite one Prophet for all,</hi> Dan. 2.1, 2. <hi>Where is mention of the great Prince, of great trouble even to the time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and then awaking of ſome (not for a ſpace of time, but) to everlaſting life, and of others (at the ſame time) unto ſhame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting contempt.

Now the cauſe why the Prophets write ſo much of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be reſtored, was, That the godly hearing of the deſtruction of that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:113937:130"/>Kingdome, did greatly feare, that that Common-wealth ſhould never be reſtored, wherein Chriſt our Saviour was to be borne, and performe the worke of redemption: we may juſtly thinke, that their feare was not ſo much the want of bodily liberty, as the not comming of our Saviour: and therfore the Prophets inſiſt much upon that point for the comfort of the godly, that howſoever that Kingdome ſhall be ruined, yet it ſhall be reſtored, and all Nations ſhall by the preaching of</hi> Jewes <hi>come into the obedience of Chriſt, and ſo receive lawes from the</hi> Jewes, <hi>as being cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives unto them, whoſe captives they might be for a time.

When you ſay of your ſelfe, It ſhall breake in peeces, and ſucceed but two of the four Empires; or when you ſay, as the Prophet doth, that it ſhall ſucceed and breake in peeces the whole image, all four Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and the Kingdomes of the laſt divided Empire? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſaying that the ſtone (the type of our Saviours manhood) was to be before the braſſe and the iron, you make Chriſt to be borne before the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire was in being; whereas it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the hiſtory of the Goſpell, that he was borne in the dayes of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, to which the <hi>Jewes</hi> were then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:113937:136"/>alone it is to be underſtood (For the ſtone cut out without hands, is Chriſt borne of a Virgin: and the mountaine out of which he was cut, is the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, the Inhabitants of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the place which God had choſen to put his Name there.) And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you hereby make the accompliſhment of the viſion, (which ſhewed things then to come) to be before the revelation of it.

And thirdly, you make the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Empire to be by an extraordinary meanes, by an Angel ſent from God; whereas it was by an ordinary meanes, by the army of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Prince of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. We leave this preſumption to your ſelfe, who have ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told God, what is moſt for his glory, pag. 15, 16. and what is moſt to the praiſe of his mercy and bountifulneſſe, pag. 68.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is revealed in expreſſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>That God ſhall ſet up a Kingdome in the dayes of theſe Kings.</hi> But not that <hi>theſe Kings and the Kingdomes which God ſhall ſet up,</hi> are to continue together. Yea the Kingdome of God could not breake in peeces theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, could not ſucceed them by conqueſt, unleſſe they ſhould be in the poſſeſſion of their ſeverall Kings, when the Kingdome of God is thus to be ſet up. And ſeeing theſe Kingdomes are to be broken in peeces, are to be conſumed, by the Kingdome which God ſhall ſet up; how can you once imagine, that their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not their confuſion: that their inſtruction, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: that their amending, and not their ending, (I meane onely in reſpect of their former diſtinſt titles and governments,) ſhould hereby be meant? Certainely you cannot finde in all the ſcripture, nor in any humane writer, ſuch a ſignification of theſe words. And as for the Chriſtian beleefe, it doth not alter the form of civill government in any Nation. But be it Democraticall, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticall, or Monarchicall, it agrees alike with all of them. Yea it conſiſted in the primitive times with the profeſſion of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> and doth now conſiſt in the Eaſterne Churches in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> ſo farre is it (in its purity and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,) from teaching us to diſturbe the peace of any Kingdome: to ſeeke, I ſay, the ſuppreſſion and removeall of the government or religion thereof, by outward violence, by the helpe of the ſword. And therefore it cannot be ſaid of the preaching of the Chriſtian faith, that it <hi>breakes in peeces, and conſumes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> in which it is profeſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>There was reaſon,</hi> you ſay, <hi>to expreſſe the Kingdome of God,</hi> ver. 44. <hi>by a thing different from the image, becauſe the foure Kingdomes were of one quality, and this of another.</hi> But doubtleſſe, (as the four were no more of one quality, then gold, ſilver, braſſe, and iron, are all of one quality, ſo) though they were all of different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities from this, yet this could not be the reaſon wherefore the Kingdome of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. was repreſented by no part of the image, but by a thing different from it: For if notwithſtanding
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:113937:138"/>their different qualities, they had been to continue together, (as you ſay) they might notwithſtanding this difference of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been repreſented together alſo: (as well as the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating Kingdomes of the divided Empire are, by the mixture of iron and clay,) but the reaſon was, becauſe the ſetting up of this Kingdome ſhould be the beginning of a new world; of a world in which all the Kingdomes on earth ſhould make but one Kingdome under Chriſt, when once the time comprehended by the image, ſhould be at an end, as it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Then was the iron, the clay, the braſſe, the ſilver, and the gold, broken in peeces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and became like the chaffe of the Summers threſhing-flores, and the winde carried them away, that no place was found for them; And the ſtone that ſmote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.</hi> And againe <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>But it ſhall breake in peeces, and conſume all theſe Kingdomes, and it</hi> (not it with any other, but it alone) <hi>ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> And that text, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world,</hi> doth helpe alſo to confirme this: for it either points out unto us the time of our Saviours reigne, or the authority by which he is to reigne. And ſo is as if he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid thus, <hi>My Kingdome is not</hi> (to be now, in the time) <hi>of this world:</hi> in the time before my next appearing: but hereafter in the time of <hi>that world to come,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. that is, at the time of my appearing againe: when all creatures ſhall be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put in ſubjection unto me. Or thus, <hi>My Kingdome</hi> (that is, the authority by which I muſt reigne,) <hi>is not</hi> (from hence, is not to be given unto me,) <hi>of the world,</hi> (that is, of men,) but I am to have it from God; I am to fetch it from him, and to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as it is in the parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in this ſenſe the expreſſion agrees very well with that Querie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25. <hi>The baptiſme of John whence was it, from heaven, or of men?</hi> And beſides all this, the Kingdome of grace, of which you underſtand the Kingdome which the God of heaven ſhould ſet up, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. was ſet up at the firſt promiſe of Chriſt, as you confeſſe <hi>pag.</hi> 9. and ſo was in the world even from the beginning: whereas that Kingdome <hi>ver.</hi> 44. was then to come, when this viſion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> And if you ſay, that the Kingdome, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. did repreſent the Kingdome of grace, as it was to be ſet up amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at the preaching of the Goſpell to them
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:113937:138"/>after our Saviours aſcenſion: Surely it was ſet up thus alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diviſion of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and therefore it cannot in this ſenſe be the Kingdome meant in <hi>ver.</hi> 44. which was to be ſet up after the diviſion of the Empire: and when ſome of the Kingdomes into which it was divided ſhould be Chriſtian, or rather Proteſtant Kingdomes, as theſe words <hi>ver.</hi> 43. doe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. <hi>And whereas thou ſaweſt iron mixed with miry clay, they ſhall mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men: but they ſhall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the dayes of theſe Kings</hi> (to wit, of theſe amongſt whom ſome that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Proteſtant Princes, ſhall <hi>mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men,</hi> ſhall joyne themſelves in marriage with unbeleeving or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Princes,) ſhall the God <hi>of heaven ſet up a Kingdome which ſhall never be deſtroyed.</hi> And at the ſetting up of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is, that the contents of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. and of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which agree ſo well with the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the image in peeces,) ſhall be accompliſhed.

                     <p>That the Apoſtle ſpeakes of a world to come, as well in reſpect of Chriſt, as of himſelfe, it is evident, firſt from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhewes, that the world, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>[the world to come,]</hi> is the world, in which thoſe workes of God are, that he made for man to have dominion over: is the world, I ſay, in which the beaſts of the field, the fowles of the aire, and the fiſhes of the ſea doe inhabit. And ſecondly, it is cleare from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word, by which it is expreſt: which is not [<gap reason="foreign">

And therefore <hi>the Kingdome of heaven</hi> in your ſenſe, that is, Chriſts poſſeſſion of heaven, and his reigning over the Saints departed, cannot poſſibly be meant by it; but the <hi>Kingdome of heaven</hi> in our ſenſe, that is, the heavenly Kingdome which Chriſt ſhall here viſibly reigne over in time to come, In the day, (the great day) <hi>in which God hath appointed to judge</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>] <hi>the world in righteouſneſſe by him,</hi> as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. that is, to execute <hi>judgement and juſtice on the earth,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>chap.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 5.

And it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the text, that this Kingdome of God, is to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in which there ſhall be eating of bread, that is, (according to the ſignification of this phraſe in the Goſpell,) of ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as God hath ordained for mans food on earth: this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God muſt needes be meant of a Kingdome on earth; and conſequently, the recompence our Saviour ſpake of, is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on earth, and the reſurrection of the Saints to enjoy this Kingdome, is to precede the riſing of all others, which ſhall not be, till the time of this Kingdome be ſully expired.

For neither the firſt not the laſt reſurrection ſhall be till the laſt day, and yet both ſhall be in the laſt day: ſeeing the laſt day ſhall beginne with the firſt reſurrection, and end with the laſt. But yet we have good reaſon to beleeve that our Saviour ſpake here only of the firſt of theſe reſurrections, becauſe in <hi>v.</hi> 54. he ſpeakes onely of raiſing them that ſhould be worthy parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Sacrament of his body and bloud, which Sacrament is to ſhew forth the Lords death till he come, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and for ought we yet know no longer.

And ſeeing the reſurrection of their bodies doth equally belong to the godly and the ungodly, why ſhould we not thinke, that he would as well have ſpoken of the reſurrection of theſe alſo, as of the other: if they had been to riſe at the ſame time with the other?

                        <hi>The queſtion is,</hi> you ſay, <hi>whether Saint John ſaw theſe Elders in heaven?</hi> And that he did the text it ſelfe doth witneſſe. For that theſe Elders were the ſame with the Elders in <hi>chap.</hi> 4. the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the viſion doth infallibly evince. And that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw thoſe Elders in heaven, the 1 <hi>ver.</hi> of the 4 <hi>chap.</hi> doth clearly prove, where it is ſaid, <hi>After this I looked, and behold a doore was opened in heaven, and the firſt voyes which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet, talking with mee, which ſaid, Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things which muſt be hereafter.</hi> Now what heaven was it in which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw a doore opened, but the ſtarry heaven, the ſame heaven, which Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw opened, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.56? And what heaven was it, from whence he heard a voice talking with him, but the third heaven? in the third heaven it was then (whither Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was once caught up,) that Saint <hi>John</hi> heard and ſaw ſuch wonderfull viſions, and revelations, as ſoone as he was in the ſpirit, that is, as ſoone as hee was carried up by the ſpirit, whither he was before called by the voice. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he ſaw theſe Elders in heaven: and this alſo the 6 and 7 <hi>verſes</hi> of the 5 <hi>chap.</hi> doe confirme, which ſhew that theſe Elders were there, where our Saviour (repreſented by the Lambe that had been ſlaine) was, when the booke of Revelation was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him. And as Saint <hi>John</hi> faw theſe Elders in heaven,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:113937:154"/>ſo <hi>Pareus</hi> makes report alſo of two ſorts of interpreters, who by theſe Elders doe underſtand Saints in heaven. One, which takes them for foure and twenty and no more, for twelve Patriarches, and twelve Apoſtles. Another, which takes them for all the Saints then in heaven, to which interpretation he himſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines. And <hi>Piſcator</hi> underſtands by them all the faithfull under both Teſtaments, under the Law, and under the Goſpell; and ſo makes theſe 24 Elders to repreſent not onely the Saints then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but all others alſo which ſhould depart before Chriſts appearing. And now ſeeing the text ſhews that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw theſe Elders in heaven; and interpreters ſay, that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Saints departed, how can their words, <hi>we ſhall reigne on earth;</hi> be underſtood any otherwiſe then of their reigning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their reſurrection? Yea let them be taken for the Saints on earth, and yet their words cannot be otherwiſe underſtood. For if they did repreſent the Saints militant on earth, they did then reigne ſpiritually when they ſpake theſe words. And therefore ſeeing notwithſtanding their ſpirituall reigne, they ſaid not, <hi>we doe,</hi> but, <hi>we ſhall reigne on earth;</hi> it is evident, that their words cannot be meant of a reigne which they ſhould enjoy on earth, while they were in their bodies before their death, (which by your owne confeſſion can be no other but a ſpirituall reigne) but of a reigne, which they ſhould enjoy on earth, when they are againe reunited to their bodies after their death. And whereas the words in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be heire of the world, &amp;c.</hi> are by you thus interpreted, [<hi>That he ſhould be heire of eternall life, Tit.</hi> 8.7.] When you can prove that [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="3">3. In the preceding words, you aske [<hi>what perfection of wit it is to imagine, that men who ſhall beheaded</hi>— <hi>are more perfect then the ſoules of them that are beheaded.</hi>] And ſo in that paſſage you grant, that I doe take the ſoules which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw, for the ſoules of men beheaded. And yet here you make your ſelfe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſenſe in which I take them. For you ſay <hi>[If by theſe ſoules he underſtand the ſpirituall part of men ere they be made perfect, then be muſt underſtand the ſoules before they entred into the bodies, or

And what perfection of wit were it, by ſoules onely to underſtand ſoules entred into bodies? Or what are both theſe parts of your anſwer, but a vaine wreſting of the wordes <hi>[perfect men,]</hi> which (to avoide the anſwering of my argument) you purpoſely miſtake, for regenerate men: for men perfect in grace. Whereas <hi>[perfect men,]</hi> oppoſed to the ſoules of men onely, muſt needs ſignifie, men perfect in eſſence, men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting both of bodies and ſoules. And therefore that the reader may ſee how poorely you have ſhifted off the force of my words; I will lay it before him in this Syllogiſme. If Saint <hi>John</hi> at firſt ſaw the ſoules onely of them that were beheaded, and not men that ſhould be beheaded, then by the word, <hi>[they lived,]</hi> is meant the living againe of them that had been beheaded, (the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of men after their death,) and not the regenerating of them that ſhould be beheaded, (the riſing of men before their death.) But Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw onely the ſoules of them that were beheaded, and not men that ſhould be beheaded. Therefore by the word <hi>[they lived,]</hi> is meant the living of them that had been beheaded, (the riſing of men after their death,) and not the regenerating of them that ſhould be beheaded, (the riſing of men before their death.) For the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="4">4. This argument is a meere <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a begging of the point in queſtion, for it ſuppoſeth, that the firſt reſurrection is to be underſtood ſpiritually, which in the very ſubject of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. And therefore it is juſt as if you had ſaid, If the firſt reſurrection be that which we ſay it is, then it goes before the Saints death, as we ſay it doth: &amp; ſurely if interpreters do expound the firſt reſurrection of the Saints, <hi>[of the forſaking of Antichriſt's errours, of their not worſhipping of the Beaſt, nor receiving his marke, and of their conſtant profeſſion, &amp;c:]</hi> then they doe underſtand it of the effects and conſequents of the ſpirituall reſurrection, and not of the ſpirituall reſurrection it ſelfe; For the regeneration of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:113937:157"/>the Saints, is the change and renewing of their ſoules by the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſanctifying and ſaving graces of their regeneration. And they doe herein put a tautology upon the text, which according to this interpretation muſt be thus paraphraſed, <hi>And I ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, neither had received his marke upon their foreheads, or in their hands, and they lived,</hi> that is, and they worſhipped not the Beaſt, not his image, nor received his marke, &amp;c.

For thus he governed the whole world, and his Church in the world, as much before his incarnation, as he hath done ſince.

And ſurely this Kingdome is not yet begun, nor ſhall beginne till Antichriſt be deſtroyed, and conſequently, the foreſaid abſurdity touching the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt the riſing and reigning of the Saints, doth inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow upon the ſpirituall interpretation of the firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

For there can be no ſpirituall Kingdome on earth, unleſſe there be withall a temporall, a civill Kingdome, in which it may be ſet up. And the text ſpeakes not of ſpirituall Kingdomes, but of temporall; for it ſaith, <hi>The Kingdomes of this world,</hi> that is, the temporall and civill Kingdomes, which the Kings of this world doe reigne over. <hi>Theſe Kingdomes,</hi> it ſaith, (be they the Kingdomes of Chriſtian, or of heat hen Princes,) <hi>ſhall become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſhall by the Lord be put under the government of his Chriſt, as he is man. And therefore the Kingdomes themſelves ſhall not be then utterly <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> as you ſay, but be made one Kingdome under Chriſt, as we ſay. And indeede if we doe but call to minde the time when this prophecy is to be fulfilled, which is at the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the laſt trumpet, when Chriſt himſelfe ſhall deſcend from heaven; we cannot imagine, that the Kingdomes of this world ſhould then become the Kingdomes of Chriſt, any otherwiſe then by a ſubjection unto his manhood: then by ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That the binding up of Satan, and the thouſand yeares reigne of the Saints were to contemporate, you doe not deny; but that the binding up of Satan is to ſucced the deſtruction of the beaſt and falſe prophet as well in the execution thereof, as it doth in the order of its revelation <hi>[it doth not follow]</hi> you ſay; and yet you bring no reaſon againſt it, whereas we have theſe unanſwerable evidences in the Text for it. Firſt, that upon the binding up of Satan a thouſand yeares peace is to follow in the world: and ſecondly, that throughout this time, Satan is to be withheld from deceiving the Nations; neither of which was ever yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: For when was there amongſt men ſuch a time of reſt from warre as this? or any time at all of immunity from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations? Whereas therefore you underſtand by Satans impriſonment, no more then his reſtraint from <hi>[raging and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting openly,]</hi> it is flat againſt the Text, which ſaith, that when Satan is ſhut up, <hi>he ſhall not deceive the Nations:</hi> and not that he ſhall not ſtirre them up to open perſecution: which is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effect of his deceiving of them. And beſides may not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret perſecution be farre worſe then an open? And is not a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deceive Chriſtians <hi>[by lies, and fained miracles,]</hi> more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Church of God, then both theſe? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then could this prophecy afford the faithfull, if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Satans impriſonment, Antichriſt ſhould ſtill prevaile ſo
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:113937:162"/>much amongſt men? Or what new thing had been here revealed unto Saint <hi>John,</hi> if no more but this had been meant, by the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of Satan? But indeed when Satan ſhall be caſt into the bottomleſſe pit, and a ſeale ſet upon him, he ſhall be debarred, not onely from tempting, but from walking up and downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; and therefore it is no better then meere non-ſence to ſay, that when Satan is bound up, and withheld from decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man, he may yet have an inſtrument <hi>[ſitting in the Church of God, deceiving the world, &amp;c.]</hi> For can any man be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Satan, when Satan himſelfe ſhall neither have power to deceive him, nor liberty to come neare him? Thus then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Antichriſts exiſtence, and continuance in the Church after Satans impriſonment, and reſtraint, doth plainely croſſe not onely the order of this Revelation, but the evidence of the Text.

                     <p n="1">1. That our Saviours Kingdome is to be a diſtinct Kingdome, both in time and condition from the Kingdomes of this world, is a truth apparantly delivered in the ſcriptures. And for ought you have ſaid to the contrary, we may ſtill thinke, that theſe words of Chriſt doe intimate as much. For though you firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>[that theſe words doe diſtinguiſh betwixt the time of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and other Kingdomes,]</hi> yet you preſently give this ſenſe to them your ſelfe, when you ſay, <hi>[My Kingdome is not from hence, that is, My Kingdome is at hand.]</hi> And therefore it was not then in the world; and if not then, ſure I am, it hath not been yet: and ſo it is diſtinct in time too from other Kingdomes, as well as in condition. I ſay it hath not been yet, for what Kingdome of Chriſt hath been ſet up in the world ſince he ſpake theſe words, which was not in the world when he ſpake theſe words? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely his ſpirituall Kingdome was as much in the world at that time, though not ſpread ſo much over the world, as it hath been ſince. That Kingdome therefore, which you ſay was not then, but <hi>was at hand,</hi> is not yet come; as the teſtimonies which you have alledged to prove that it was then at hand, doe teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you alſo. For that text <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. doth ſpeake of a Kingdome to beginne at Chriſts appearing, and not before it: of a Kingdome, I ſay, when the Sonne of man ſhall come, as it is in the ſame <hi>verſe;</hi> and when the Sonne of man ſhall come in the glory of the Father with his Angels, as it is in the preceding <hi>verſe.</hi> And therefore doubtleſſe theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely I ſay unto you, there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſt of death, till they ſee the Sonne of man comming in his Kingdome,</hi> doe reveale a ſtrange and extraordinary preſervation of ſome then preſent, till Chriſts next appearing. For what doth the <hi>[com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Sonne of man]</hi> ſignifie, but Chriſts deſcending from heaven? and why did he ſubjoyne theſe words to his ſpeech, touching his comming <hi>in the glory of the Father with his Angels,</hi> but becauſe they are meant of the ſame comming? And beſides the Goſpell had been before preacht, by the Baptiſt, by Chriſt himſelfe, and by the Diſciples; and not ſome, but all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples lived to ſee it preacht among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo; and therefore
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:113937:163"/>the ſeeing of this could not be the meaning of our Saviours words. Thus then this firſt text doth ſhew, that the Kingdome of our Saviour is not yet come. And the other text <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. doth ſhew onely, That the Goſpell of the Kingdome, (that is, which makes report of the Kingdome, or by which men are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Kingdome of Chriſt,) ſhould be preached in all the world before the <hi>end ſhould come:</hi> that is, the end and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the ſubſequent <hi>verſes</hi> doe declare; and not the end of the world, as you affirme. For would Chriſt, thinke you, have adviſed them to flye out of <hi>Judea</hi> into the mountaines, from his preſence at the end of the world? Or how ſhould it be worſe for women with child, and for them that give ſucke at his comming then for others? And now as for your expoſition of theſe words, <hi>[My Kingdome is not from hence, that is, My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is at hand]</hi> I pray what interpreters doe you follow in it? or what colour have you for it?

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:113937:167"/>place cannot be underſtood of the departing of the Scepter for a time, as it was in the captivity of</hi> Babylon; <hi>which becauſe it was but a ſhort time, and the Scepter was reſtored againe, it was not thought to be the accompliſhment of the prophecy: but now ſeeing the Scepter is departed, and the Nations have been gathered unto Chriſt, who ſhould doubt of the accompliſhment thereof? and ſo that Scepter cannot be reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Jewes.</p>

                     <p>What? not reſtored? doth <hi>Jacobs</hi> prophecy then foreſhew, that the Scepter ſhould no more be reſtored to the <hi>Jewes</hi> after Chriſts comming? or doth it foreſhew onely, that it ſhould not depart till Chriſts comming? certainely it foreſhewes this laſt thing onely. And therefore the accompliſhment of <hi>Jacobs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy hath no affinity with your argument. And in ſaying that the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah</hi> in the captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> you plainely contradict <hi>Jacobs</hi> prophecy, which ſaith, that it ſhould not depart <hi>from Judah till Shiloh came.</hi> And as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſhewes, that it was not to depart till then, ſo others do ſhew, that it was to returne againe, as that of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.5. which ſhewes that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould abide many dayes, (but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,) without a King, and without a Prince, and without a ſacrifice, &amp;c. And all the prophecies which foreſhew the <hi>Jewes</hi> deliverance, the uniting of the Tribes under one King, and our Saviours reigning over them, doe witneſſe the reſtoring of the Scepter. And Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> application of that prophecy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. doth ſhew when the Scepter is to be reſtored, to wit, <hi>When the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in.</hi> For then he ſaith, <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, There ſhall come out of Sion a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and ſhall turne away ungodlineſſe from Jacob.</hi> And ſo he plainely declares, that the accompliſhment of this prophecy ſhall be at Chriſts laſt comming, at his comming, I ſay, after the the gathering of the ſubſtituted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (who were in the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſtead to become Gods people in the vacancy of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) and at the gathering of all other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are to become Gods people with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> at the reſtoring of the Scepter. And agreeable to this are Saint <hi>Peters</hi> words to the <hi>Jewes, Acts</hi> 4.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and Saviour, for to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi>

                     <p>Did you confider what you ſaid, when you thus expounded the Apoſtles words? Certainely the Apoſtle ſpeakes of a wrath which was come upon the unbeleeving <hi>Jewes,</hi> who perſecuted their beleeving brethren, &amp; not of a wrath which was come upon the beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> that were perſecuted, whom the loſſe of their countrey, and the departing of the Scepter did concerne as well as it did the other <hi>Iewes.</hi> And therefore doubtleſſe the wrath is to be underſtood of a wrath peculiar unto the unbeleeving <hi>Iewes,</hi> (of whom alone the Apoſtle ſpeakes,) and conſequently of a ſpirituall wrath eſpecially, and of a temporall wrath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then as it is an inſeparable effect and concomitant of the ſpirituall wrath which is come upon them. And though this expreſſion of the Apoſtle doth imply that a great wrath, and a wrath of long continuance was come upon them: yet it doth not ſhew that the wrath which was befallen them, ſhould be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wrath. And therefore whatſoever the kinde of it be, it will no more follow from this paſſage of the Apoſtle, that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kingdome of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall not be reſtored unto them, then it will, that their ſpirituall blindneſſe ſhall never be removed from them. Of the departure whereof, the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. ſpeakes ſo much, and ſo manifeſtly: ſhewing that as there was <hi>a diminiſhing and caſting away of them;</hi> ſo there ſhould be alſo, <hi>a fulneſſe of them, a receiving of them againe.</hi> And the 5 and 28 <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>chapter,</hi> which you alledge to ſhew that the foreſaid words in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. are not to be underſtood of a ſpirituall wrath, doe indeed rather confirme, then confute this expoſition.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:113937:168"/>roome, were become the enemies of the Goſpell of Chriſt: and conſequently not of ſuch on whom God had mercy, or would have mercy, any otherwiſe then in making of them inſtruments for the fulfilling of his promiſe made unto the Fathers, touching that elect remnant of their poſterity, whom he purpoſed to call by a generall converſion.</p>

(Which as it is already proved, ſhall happen at the ſame time.) And though God, as he is eternall, cannot be meaſured by time: and as he is immutable, feeles no alteration in time: a thouſand, (yea ten thouſand times ten thouſand) yeares, and one day, (houre or minute of a day,) being in this reſpect all one to him: yet this ſhift cannot void the expoſition already given; ſeeing the apparent dependance of theſe words on the former, doth clearely prove, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> intended not to ſhew, what a thouſand yeares, and one day were to God in regard of his nature, (which it is like they knew before,) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is uſually meant by one day in the word of God.

All this then being undeniable, there can be no truth in your foreſaid words.

For firſt, it is not ſaid here, that they ſhall be gathered together before Chriſt, as it is ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that <hi>the Angels ſhall gather them out of Chriſts Kingdome, and caſt them into a furnace of fire:</hi> that is, ſhall deſtroy them in every place over the world where they then are, and caſt their ſoules into hell, as is intimated by <hi>the binding of the tares in bundles to burne them.</hi> That is, as they finde them here and there in the field. And ſecondly, it is ſaid, that they <hi>ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of Chriſts Kingdome, and caſt into bell,</hi> that is, ſhall be taken away from the place where, and from among the men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom Chriſt ſhall then reigne. And therefore this gathering of the wicked i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to be at the beginning of Chriſts Kingdome, and before their laſt judgement: and not at the end of Chriſts Kingdome, when they ſhall be fetcht out of hell againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their laſt judgement. And that the foreſaid judgement is meant of a temporall deſtruction on all obſtinate ſinners, that are living at Chriſts comming, and not of the eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies and ſoules together at the laſt reſurrection, it is evident alſo from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9. where it is revealed, that all the ungodly that are to oppoſe the Saints at the end of the thouſand yeares reigne, ſhall be devoured by fire from heaven, before the laſt reſurrection; ſo that there ſhall be none of them living on the earth, when they are to be gathered before Chriſt at the laſt judgement: and conſequently, that gathering of them
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:113937:171"/>cannot be the ſame with this gathering of them, when they ſhall be on the earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. And ſo by <hi>the Kingdome of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 43. muſt needes be meant, <hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 41. which in called, <hi>the Kingdome of their Father,</hi> becauſe Chriſt with whom theſe Saints ſhall reigne, ſhall receive it of God, who is both his and their Father.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The righteous ſhall be caught up to meete Chriſt, and to come along with him to the earth. And not to ſtay with him in the aire, or to be carried up to heaven from thence; as hath been ſhewed already more then once. And therefore this is but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling argument.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This argument is a ſuppoſition of that which we deny. For it is our argument againſt you, That ſeeing the elect onely ſhall be raiſed and gathered together at Chriſts comming, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly which are left in their graves, (and that the miſchievous ungodly which are living, ſhall be left alſo to periſh extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41, 42. and the reſt to be eye-witneſſes of Gods wonders at that time, and to become converts by it, as it is <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.19, 20. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.32. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. and in other places.) Therefore the laſt judgement, the great Aſſiſe, (which is to be held chiefly for the condemnation of ungodly men,) cannot be at, or preſently after Chriſts comming, but ſhall be at the end of his reigne. And ſo this part of your anſwer is a meere perverting of my words, which agree ſo well in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with the word of God, that you had nought to ſay againſt that which they prove, and therefore you fallaciouſly make them to grant, what they doe indeed diſprove.</p>

For what is <hi>the great ſound of the trumpet</hi> mentioned by the Evangeliſt, but the <hi>blowing of the great trumpet</hi> foretold in <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> And ſecondly, it is evident from the contents of the prophecy which ſpeake not of the returne of the two Tribes, of the returne of the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> from <hi>Babylon:</hi> but of the returne of the ten Tribes, of the returne of the captivity of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aſsyria;</hi> who, as Divines confeſſe, did never yet returne. And admit it had been ſpoken of the returne of the two Tribes, yet it could not be already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, becauſe it foreſhewes the returne of the <hi>Jewes</hi> out of <hi>Aſsyria</hi> in a time when they ſhall be ready <hi>to periſh there;</hi> which

                        </gap>eade not of the ſounding of any trumpet at the proclamation. And if it had been a cuſtome to doe ſo, not one, but many trumpets doubtleſſe had been ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the publiſhing of that proclamation, which was by many meſſengers ſent into all the Provinces of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Kingdome, to whom God had given all <hi>the Kingdomes of the earth, Ezra</hi> 1.2.

                     <p>Doubtleſſe God is not to be taught by us, <hi>[what reward is moſt to the praiſe of his mercy and bountifulneſſe towards the godly.]</hi> But we are to account that reward moſt to the praiſe of his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and mercy towards them, which we find in his word to be appointed unto them. And we doe conceive, that the glory of the Saints after their reunion to their bodies, will be greater (becauſe more perfect) though they live on earth: then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their ſoules is now without the fellowſhip of their glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies. And we know not what ſhould interrupt their glory on earth, when as Chriſt himſelfe, (on whom the Angels ſhall viſibly attend,) ſhall be on earth with them: and God himſelfe alſo may here manifeſt his glory unto them, in what meaſure hee pleaſeth. And though <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſome other of the Patriarches, (to whom God had promiſed the poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>) did in their corruptible eſtate here live as ſtrangers and pilgrimes in that land; yet they ſhall not after their reſurrection poſſeſſe it as ſtrangers and pilgrimes, but as
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:113937:176"/>heires and coheires with Chriſt. And where as you ſay, <hi>[That it is a greater gift of God, that the godly ſhould abide in that glory of heaven for ever and ever, then to come againe from the heavens to abide on earth.]</hi> You ſeeme to me to imagine, that the godly ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againe come from thence, (as your denying alſo, <hi>pag.</hi> 54. that Chriſt ſhall bring all the Saints with him, doth teſtifie againſt you,) which conceit is contrary to all the ſcriptures that affirme the reſurrection, and the Saints appearing with Chriſt. And I pray, where doe you finde in ſcripture, that the Saints ſhall after their reſurrection live in a place ſeparate from the earth? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they are after the laſt judgement, to be tranſlated into the new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and that City is then to deſcend to the new earth, as we read <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3. And laſtly, what affinity hath ought that you have ſaid here, with the uſe you anſwer? what! ſhall we not praiſe God for his mercy in making us partakers of the fatneſſe of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Olive tree, while we are here; although it were a greater happineſſe for us to be ever in heaven after our departure, then to come againe to the earth?</p>

                     <p>This Query as it doth in it ſelfe containe an apparent untruth, ſo it is grounded on a miſreport of our Tenet. For firſt it makes us to thinke, that there ſhall be no <hi>Jewes</hi> converted, untill the whole Nation be converted; whereas we hold the partiall, and (as I may ſo call it,) typicall converſion of them, the converſion of them, I ſay, in their firſt fruites, with you; and the generall and contemporating converſion of them, the converſion of them in the whole lump, againſt you. Onely we ſay, that the partiall and ſucceſſive converſion, their converſion in ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and families, hath ſince the Apoſtles dayes been very thinne and rare. Secondly, you make us to thinke, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall not be converted till Chriſt comes, when as we hold, that they ſhall be converted before his comming, and be wholly freed from the oppoſition of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at and by his comming; at the judgement which ſhall light on the world when he deſcends to deſtroy the Army in <hi>Armageddon.</hi> And thridly, you make us to thinke, that there ſhall be no ſpirituall union betwixt the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the time of the thouſand yeares reigns, whereas there is not to be a full and perfect union betwixt them, in their acknowledgement and worſhip of the true God till then, and in that time. As our Saviours prophecy <hi>John</hi> 10.16. and <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:113937:177"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. and many other doe witneſſe. And though the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall then be tributaries to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> yet they ſhall be much more happy in this ſubjection, wherein they ſhall have Chriſt for their King, and the glorified Saints for their chiefe governours under him, then ever they were in their former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; which for the moſt part they ſo much abuſed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Gods everlaſting wrath againſt them. Even as now you account that <hi>Jew</hi> which is become the Lords free-man, which ſavingly embraceth the truth of the Goſpell, much more happy in his captivity under, and ſubjection to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> then if he were Lord of the whole earth, and withall a ſtranger from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world. Theſe are your miſreports, and as for your Query it ſelfe, it is falſe to imagine; that the knowledge of the converſion of a few <hi>Jewes,</hi> can move us to a greater love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, then the knowledge of the converſion of the whole Nation can. And what love ſoever you may grant to be due to them, in your diſpute of it: we may well thinke, that you make ſhew of little towards them in your actions, as theſe words <hi>pag.</hi> 65. <hi>[Let Jewes follow Jewiſh fables, &amp;c.]</hi> doe manifeſt. In which there neither appeares any ſymptome of your deſire of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, nor of your love towards them, or us.</p>

                           <hi>Whether can theſe more confidently beſeech God for the converſion of the</hi> Jewes, <hi>who thinke, that the</hi> Jewes <hi>may daily be converted; or theſe who thinke, that they ſhall not be converted till the comming of Chriſt? the former ſort may be confident to be heard daily, which theſe others cannot. And moreover the former ſort ſeeth, (as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did ſee,</hi> Heb. 11.13,) <hi>everlaſting glory preſently at hand; and thereupon they doe minde and ſeeke heavenly things, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2. <hi>and the other ſort are out of hope of glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (at leaſt,) yet for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares, and they ſet their affections on things on earth.

For which cauſe the Lord would not give unto men the knowledge of that time, but will have us to be alwayes preparing and waiting for that comming to judgement. Wherefore we pray unto our Lord Jeſus, who even now is King of Kings, and reigneth in the midſt of his enemies, and is offended at the fooliſh conceites of unſtable hearts, That he would make his power manifeſt by conforming them whom he hath called and gifted with the knowledge of his eternall Goſpell, and

                     <p>Surely they that deny the generall converſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as you doe, cannot pray at all for this converſion. But they that beleeve it, may confidently beſeech God for it; and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent too, that they are delightfully heard of him in it. For as we ought alwayes to pray for that which may be done we know not how ſoone; ſo though our prayers cannot haſten the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any future bleſſings to our ſelves or others, yet we are daily heard in them; ſeeing by ſuch a manifeſtation of out obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God, who taught us to pray for them; and of our faith and hope in his promiſes, which reveale them; and of our charity towards all that are to be partakers of them; we daily improve Gods mercy towards us here, and our owne weight of glory with him hereafter. And whereas you ſeeme to lay claime to heaven for your ſelfe and others of your minde onely; and to ſhut us out of it, becauſe according to the tenour of Gods plaine revelations, we affirme, That the raiſed Saints are to beginne the eternity of their immortall and glorified eſtate, in a regall condition here on earth with Chriſt; where He and They have been formerly ſo much reviled, and ſo vilely handled: whereas I ſay, you would for this exclude us from having any portion of the joyes of heaven with you, till the 1000 yeares reigne be finiſht; Be it knowne unto you, That we hope through Gods free mercy towards us in Chriſt Jeſus, to be received into the ſociety of the Saints in heaven, even as others; if God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, before the appearing of our Lord Jeſus; if not, we hope together with the whole number of the elect, to be made Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> in that time in which God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bring us thither, and not before. And we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that we doe ſet our affections <hi>on things on earth,</hi> (in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:113937:178"/>Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.2.) when we doe with patience expect the accompliſhment of the promiſes made to us in Chriſt, albeit they are in part to be fulfilled on this earth. And by the way, it is worth the Readers obſervation, That to confirme <hi>[your ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting glory preſently at hand,]</hi> you cite <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. where it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe all died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeene them afarre off, &amp;c.</hi> What I is to ſee the promiſes a farre off, all one, with the ſeeing of glory preſently at hand? But you goe on, and tell us, that our Tenet <hi>[gives encouragement to the wicked, that they ſhall not be judged, nor their bodies tormented theſe thouſand yeares to come yet.]</hi> Which is a confuſed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt report of our words: For though we ſay, That the laſt judgement of the wicked, the judgement of their bodies and foules together ſhall not be till the end of the thouſand yeares reigne on earth; yet ſurely we beleeve even as others, That their ſoules are caſt into hell, immediately after their departure out of their bodies. And doubtleſſe, if they will not forſake their evill courſes for feare of the imminent damnation of their ſoules; for feare of this partiall and particular judgement at their death, (which doth infallibly binde them over to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation of their bodies and ſoules together, at their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and contemporating judgement,) they will neither forſake their wickedneſſe the ſooner for their ignorance, nor continue it the longer-for their knowledge of the large ſpace of time that is yet to precede their generall judgement. For what comfort can it be to them, that it ſhall be yet ſo long before their bodies be tortured in hell, when as their ſoules may ſuddenly be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuch torments as are agreeable to the number and nature of their ſinnes: which the more and greater they are, the more and greater will the puniſhment of their bodies be too at the laſt? And therefore if you had ſaid the truth, you would have acknowledged, that our Tenet doth warne all thoſe that ſhall live in the time of the <hi>Jewes</hi> converſion and deliverance, not to oppoſe them, leſt to the augmentation of their endleſſe woe, they therby periſh from the earth by a fearefull death. And it doth perſwade men likewiſe, to take off their affections from things on earth, ſeeing it puts them in minde, that if they now walke
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:113937:179"/>not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; if they faſhion not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this preſent world, they ſhall together with their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, be heires, and inheritours of the earth, when the whole creation ſhall be delivered from its bondage of corruption; and when by the meanes of Chriſts and their government on it, <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall runne downe as waters, and righteouſneſſe as a mighty ſtreame.</hi> And thus the impartiall reader may plainely ſee, what little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance there is betwixt the title of your anſwer, and the contents of it; For you pretend to fetch him out of darkeneſſe into the light; but doe indeed lead him out of the light into darkeneſſe.

Now the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, ſhine in our hearts, that as of ſincerity, as of God, we may give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. That, Iſay, without handling of the word of God deceitfully, we may by manifeſtation of the truth commend our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God; that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be praiſe and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THere was of late in this Kingdome one Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> a grave and learned Divine of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who in his Treatiſes on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> (which he publiſht to the world ſome yeares before his death,) doth plainely profeſſe, that he held not onely the <hi>Jewes</hi> generall converſion, but their returne to their countrey too, and the thouſand yeares reigne of Chriſt and the Saints on earth. Of which reigne as he hath a particular Tract, ſo in the fourth ſynchroniſme of the ſecond part of his <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica</hi> he ſhewes by infallible arguments, that it is to ſucceed the utter deſtruction of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, and to contemporate with the 1000 yeares binding up of Satan; That it is, I ſay, to be in the time betwixt the deſtruction of the two Armies revealed in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. which he there clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againſt this Authour while he lived no man moved his pen, although there was both time and opportunity to have done it, but ſince his deceaſe, (which is an uſuall courſe with the enemies of the truth,) as there have been many, who have voted againſt him without anſwering any of his workes; ſo there have been ſome, who have undertaken to examine here and there a piece of his labours, amongſt whom Mr. <hi>Petrie</hi> is one, who in <hi>pag.</hi> 14.60.61. of his anſwer to <hi>Iſraels</hi> Redemption, doth aſſay the confutation of two of Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> ſynchroniſmes.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:113937:181"/>Impoſſible then it is, that <hi>theſe laſt plagues,</hi> theſe plagues which were to befall the Beaſt in her laſt time onely, ſhould befall her <hi>[in her height of her pride, in her greateſt pompe,]</hi> that is, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her laſt time. For this is all one as if you had ſaid, that the Beaſt then began to be deſtroyed, when ſhe was moſt inſenſible of her deſtruction, when ſhe had leaſt cauſe to feare it. And therefore though <hi>[the Saints in heaven, (and on earth too,) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for their particular victory over the Beaſt as yet reigning;]</hi> yet doubtleſſe they ſhall not ſing <hi>Moſes</hi> ſong of thankſgiving, for the utter overthrow of the Beaſt, before the Beaſt be utterly overthrowne. And though the vials were to be powred out at ſeverall times, yet as in their orderly powrings out they were ſuddenly to ſucceed each other; ſo likewiſe they were all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to contemporate with the laſt time of the Beaſt onely.</p>

                        <hi>And the rather may we judge ſo, that we finde ſuch agreement in the principall termes of the ſeven trumpets, and ſeven vials; the ſecond trumpet with the ſecond viall; the third trumpet with the third viall; the fourth trumpet with the fourth viall; the ſixt trumpet with the ſixt viall; and the ſeventh trumpet with the ſeventh viall. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt trumpet is of the ſame time with the beginning of the Beaſt,</hi> (<hi>as he ſaith</hi> ſynchro. 1. par. 2.) <hi>the firſt viall muſt be of that ſame time alſo; and all the other ſynchroniſmes and expoſitions of texts that are grounded on the ſeventh ſynchroniſme of the firſt part are wrong.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſwer.</label> If there be ſuch agreement betwixt, the trumpets and vials, as you pretend; the trumpets cannot poſſibly contemporate with the whole time of the Beaſt, as you hold; ſeeing the vials containe the laſt plagues that are to befall the Beaſt, which could not beginne to be powred out while the Beaſt was to remaine in her height, and much leſſe could they beginne to be powred out as ſoone as the Beaſt began. Whenſoever therefore the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were to beginne, ſure I am that there is not that agreement betwixt the trumpets and vials, as you imagine. For as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the firſt and fift trumpets and vials agree not, ſo neither doe the effects of the third, fourth, and ſixt. For at the ſounding of the third trumpet, <hi>the third part of the rivers and fountaines of waters doe become ſo bitter, that men dye of them becauſe they are made
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:113937:181"/>bitter.</hi> Whereas at the powring out of the third viall, <hi>the rivers and fountaines of waters are turned into bloud.</hi> And at the ſounding of the fourth trumpet, <hi>the third part of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres is ſmitten with darkeneſſe;</hi> whereas the fourth viall <hi>is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Sunne onely, and power given him</hi> (thereby) <hi>to ſcorch men with fire,</hi> ſo that by reaſon of <hi>their great heat, they blaſpheme the Name of God, which hath power over theſe plagues.</hi> And at the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſixt trumpet, <hi>the foure Angels bound in the great river Euphrates are looſed, who with an extraordinary and miraculous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my deſtroy the third part of men;</hi> whereas at the powring out of the ſixt viall, <hi>this river is dried up, that the way of the Kings of the Eaſt might be prepared, and the Kings of the earth and of the whole world are then alſo drawne together to the battell of the great Day of God Almighty by the Satanic all deluſion of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet.</hi> Which Army is deſtroyed by the plague of the ſeventh viall, and not in the time of the ſixt viall. And therefore there is no ſuch agreement <hi>in the principall termes of the ſeven trumpets and ſeven vials,</hi> as will either conclude, that they are of the <hi>ſame time,</hi> or that <hi>all the other ſynchroniſmes and expoſitions of texts that are grounded on the ſeventh ſynchroniſme of the firſt part, are wrong.</hi>

                     <p>This argument ſhewes, that <hi>the Kingdomes of this world are to become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of his Chriſt,</hi> at the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, and not before. That is, at the time of our Saviours deſcending from heaven, at which time the reigne of the beaſt ſhal end. And conſequently it provs firſt, that this reigne of Chriſt muſt needes follow the reigne of the beaſt, ſeeing it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:113937:183"/>beginnes not till his appearing, by which the Beaſt ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed. And ſecondly it proves, that this reigne muſt needes be on earth, ſeeing the Kingdomes which ſhall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his, are the Kingdomes of this world. And thirdly, it proves, that the time in which theſe Kingdomes ſhall become Chriſts, cannot poſſibly be the time in which he ſhall deliver up his Kingdome to the Fathers, ſeeing they ſhall then ceaſe to be his. And ſo the time of our Saviours reigne over them muſt needes be the <hi>interim,</hi> the time betwixt the reigne of the Beaſt, and the delivering up of his Kingdome to the Father. To theſe conſequences you had nothing to ſay; and therefore you catch at theſe words which follow the argument, to wit, <hi>[This is the conſummation of the myſtery of God foretold by the Prophets,]</hi> which you thus pervert. <hi>[This indeed is the conſummation of all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes foretold by the Prophets and Apoſtles: and therefore it is not to be underſtood of any earthly Kingdome.]</hi> But ſurely as the <hi>myſtery of God foretold by the Prophets,</hi> and recorded <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. is meant onely of Chriſts reigne on earth at his next appearing, when the Kingdomes of this world are to become his: ſo you can ſhew us no promiſe either in the writings of the Prophets or Apoſtles, which after the reſurrection of mens bodies, is to be enjoyed by them in heaven, in your ſenſe: that is, in a place of glory ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the earth. For as the raiſed Saints that are to come with Chriſt ſhall be on this earth all the time of his reigne; ſo at the delivering up of his Kingdome to the Father, the whole number of the elect ſhall be with him in the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which is the Paradiſe of God,) on the new earth whither it ſhall then deſcend. And ſo this ſynchroniſme being true, all the like ſynchroniſmes, and all expoſitions following upon them, muſt be true alſo.</p>
