1. ISRAELS REDEMPTION REDEEMED.

    _ The firſt part.
Jſraels Redemption.THat Chriſt is already Mat. 1. v. 20.21. Luk 2.11. Ioh. 1.29.30. &c. come; that aJſraels Redemption.THat Chriſt is already Mat. 1. v. 20.21. Luk 2.11. Ioh. 1.29.30. &c. come; that aIſrael's Redemption. 2. And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption. Againe, I know no reaſon, why we ſhould give more credit to the metaphoricall iIſrael's Redemption. And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption. Another Prophecie touching the renewed eſtate of the creatures, is to be ſeen iIſrael's Redemption. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediatelIſrael's Redemption. And this is as much as I need ſay, though not above halfe that the Prophets ſayIſrael's Redemption. And ſo I paſſe from the thing to be reſtor'd, which is the Kingdome of Iſrael: THat our Mediatour hath undergone the Offices of a Prieſt and Prophet, the Goſpel is our witneſſe: bIſrael's Redemption. And the reaſon of it, (as is intimated in the firſt words) is becauſe the time Iſrael's Redemption. The like encouragement he gave alſo to his Diſciples before his paſſion. Ye areIſrael's Redemption. I know theſe words are taken by Interpreters, for a metaphoricall expreſſion ofIſrael's Redemption. For beſides, that there is little analogy and reſemblance betwixt a perpetuall Iſrael's Redemption. And as it is evident from his owne words, that the Throne of his Kingdome is noIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre Saint Paul, whoſe words doe clearely prove, that the reigne of ChriſIſrael's Redemption. Of this Kingdome alſo ſpeakes Saint Peter, in Acts 3.19. Repent ye therefore, aIſrael's Redemption And here we may call to minde too, our Saviours words to Iames and Iohn, when thIſrael's Redemption. Which ſaying, as it doth ſhew that our Saviour had before acquainted the ApoſtlIſrael's Redemption. Which is a Prerogative peculiar to the Sonne alone, a preheminence, I ſay, whicIſrael's Redemption. And the ſame Apoſtles words, in 2 Tim. 4. may not be forgotten: I charge thee, Iſrael's Redemption. And to my ſeeming, that propheticall image in the 2 of Dan. ver. 13. which reprIſrael's Redemption. And as the falling of the ſtone upon the feece of the image, upon the laſt, andIſrael's Redemption. For if the Kingdome of God there ſpoken of, were to be underſtood of a KingdomeIſrael's Redemption. And that nought elſe is meant by the world to come, in Heb 2.5. but this KingdoIſrael's Redemption. And if there be yet a world which is to be put in ſubjection to Chriſt as man, Iſrael's Redemption. For that which is to be given up, is already paſt.Mr. Petrie's Anſwer.That whicIſrael's Redemption. And it is no where ſaid, that the new Jeruſalem, the City of eternall glory, ſh ANd thus it hath bin proved by conſequence, that our Saviour ſhall hereafter reigne on earth. You ſIſrael's Redemption. For neither did Chriſt at his firſt comming, ſit on Davids Throne, nor any otheIſrael's Redemption. Neither were Judah and Iſrael, then in the Land together.Mr. Petrie's Anſwer.ThIſrael's Redemption. Nei•her was the Temple then deſtroyed, but afterwards: and therefore the thingsIſrael's Redemption. You ſee here that our Saviour comes not onely to conquer death, (which is the lIſrael's Redemption. For that this may be fulfilled, it is requiſite, that he be on earth, whither tIſrael's Redemption. And although it be ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for e ANd thus even one prophecy of Zech. doth clearely unfold, all that we averre touching our preſent ſIſrael's Redemption. Which words as they doe eſtabliſh the literall ſenſe of the Luke 14.14. ch. 20.Iſrael's Redemption. And as the Elders in Revel. 5.10. ſaid in the hearing of Saint John, Thou beſt Iſrael's Redemption. And this will appeare to a diligent eye, even out of the controverſed place in Iſrael's R•demption. It is ſaid alſo, that they lived and reigned with Chriſt a 1000 yeares. But howIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, The reigne of Chriſt doth not beginne till Antichriſt is deſtroyed,Iſrael's Redemption. The aſſumption is grounded on Rev. 11.15. which ſhewes, that till the time of tIſrael's Redemption. And this alſo is intimated, by the binding up of Rev. 20.1, 2, 3. &c. Satan a tIſrael's Redemption. Which viſion, as it is the next to that of the battell, wherein the Beaſt and f NOw againſt this which hath been ſaid touching our Saviours Kingdome, his owne words i• the 18 of SIſrael's Redemption. And to all ſuch places that mention only the diſſolution of the elements, and tIſrael's Redemption. And in my conceit, Saint Peter in the very next verſe doth intimate as much; foIſrael's Redemption. This then being ſo, I ſee not, but that Gods fore-appointment of a thouſand yeaIſrael's Redemption To this alſo may be added that i•Matth. 24.31. which ſhewes that when the Sonne Iſrael's Redemption. Who doubtleſſe are not to be left, that the evill Angels may fetch them, for thIſrael's Redemption. For that by Chriſts judging the quicke and the dead, mentioned in 2 Tim. 4. canIſrael's Redemption. And to this conjecture, Iſai. 27.12. doth ſufficiently confirme; For the great Iſrael's Redemption. And thus being thr•ughly ſatisfied by this cloud of witneſſes, the double Jury Iſrael's Redemption. Firſt, to praiſe God for his abundant mercy, who through the fall of the Iewes,Iſrael's Redemption. Secondly, to beware of unbeliefe: which was the cauſe that the Jewes were brokeIſrael's Redemption. Thirdly, not to contemne or revile the Jewes, a fault too common in the ChriſtiIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, earneſtly to beſeech God, that he would ſpeedily put into execution

And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption. Againe, I know no reaſon, why we ſhould give more credit to the metaphoricall iIſrael's Redemption. And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption. Another Prophecie touching the renewed eſtate of the creatures, is to be ſeen iIſrael's Redemption. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediatelIſrael's Redemption. And this is as much as I need ſay, though not above halfe that the Prophets ſayIſrael's Redemption. And ſo I paſſe from the thing to be reſtor'd, which is the Kingdome of Iſrael: THat our Mediatour hath undergone the Offices of a Prieſt and Prophet, the Goſpel is our witneſſe: bIſrael's Redemption.

And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption.

And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption.

And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption.

Jſraels Redemption.THat Chriſt is already Mat. 1. v. 20.21. Luk 2.11. Ioh. 1.29.30. &c. come; that aIſrael's Redemption. 2. And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption. Againe, I know no reaſon, why we ſhould give more credit to the metaphoricall iIſrael's Redemption. And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption. Another Prophecie touching the renewed eſtate of the creatures, is to be ſeen iIſrael's Redemption. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediatelIſrael's Redemption. And this is as much as I need ſay, though not above halfe that the Prophets ſayIſrael's Redemption. And ſo I paſſe from the thing to be reſtor'd, which is the Kingdome of Iſrael: THat our Mediatour hath undergone the Offices of a Prieſt and Prophet, the Goſpel is our witneſſe: bIſrael's Redemption. And the reaſon of it, (as is intimated in the firſt words) is becauſe the time Iſrael's Redemption. The like encouragement he gave alſo to his Diſciples before his paſſion. Ye areIſrael's Redemption. I know theſe words are taken by Interpreters, for a metaphoricall expreſſion ofIſrael's Redemption. For beſides, that there is little analogy and reſemblance betwixt a perpetuall Iſrael's Redemption. And as it is evident from his owne words, that the Throne of his Kingdome is noIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre Saint Paul, whoſe words doe clearely prove, that the reigne of ChriſIſrael's Redemption. Of this Kingdome alſo ſpeakes Saint Peter, in Acts 3.19. Repent ye therefore, aIſrael's Redemption And here we may call to minde too, our Saviours words to Iames and Iohn, when thIſrael's Redemption. Which ſaying, as it doth ſhew that our Saviour had before acquainted the ApoſtlIſrael's Redemption. Which is a Prerogative peculiar to the Sonne alone, a preheminence, I ſay, whicIſrael's Redemption. And the ſame Apoſtles words, in 2 Tim. 4. may not be forgotten: I charge thee, Iſrael's Redemption. And to my ſeeming, that propheticall image in the 2 of Dan. ver. 13. which reprIſrael's Redemption. And as the falling of the ſtone upon the feece of the image, upon the laſt, andIſrael's Redemption. For if the Kingdome of God there ſpoken of, were to be underſtood of a KingdomeIſrael's Redemption. And that nought elſe is meant by the world to come, in Heb 2.5. but this KingdoIſrael's Redemption. And if there be yet a world which is to be put in ſubjection to Chriſt as man, Iſrael's Redemption.

And it is no where ſaid, that the new Jeruſalem, the City of eternall glory, ſh ANd thus it hath bin proved by conſequence, that our Saviour ſhall hereafter reigne on earth. You ſIſrael's Redemption. For neither did Chriſt at his firſt comming, ſit on Davids Throne, nor any otheIſrael's Redemption. Neither were Judah and Iſrael, then in the Land together.Mr. Petrie's Anſwer.ThIſrael's Redemption. Nei•her was the Temple then deſtroyed, but afterwards: and therefore the thingsIſrael's Redemption. You ſee here that our Saviour comes not onely to conquer death, (which is the lIſrael's Redemption. For that this may be fulfilled, it is requiſite, that he be on earth, whither tIſrael's Redemption. And although it be ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for e ANd thus even one prophecy of Zech. doth clearely unfold, all that we averre touching our preſent ſIſrael's Redemption. Which words as they doe eſtabliſh the literall ſenſe of the Luke 14.14. ch. 20.Iſrael's Redemption. And as the Elders in Revel. 5.10. ſaid in the hearing of Saint John, Thou beſt Iſrael's Redemption. And this will appeare to a diligent eye, even out of the controverſed place in Iſrael's R•demption. It is ſaid alſo, that they lived and reigned with Chriſt a 1000 yeares. But howIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, The reigne of Chriſt doth not beginne till Antichriſt is deſtroyed,Iſrael's Redemption. The aſſumption is grounded on Rev. 11.15. which ſhewes, that till the time of tIſrael's Redemption. And this alſo is intimated, by the binding up of Rev. 20.1, 2, 3. &c. Satan a tIſrael's Redemption.

And to all ſuch places that mention only the diſſolution of the elements, and tIſrael's Redemption. And in my conceit, Saint Peter in the very next verſe doth intimate as much; foIſrael's Redemption. This then being ſo, I ſee not, but that Gods fore-appointment of a thouſand yeaIſrael's Redemption To this alſo may be added that i•Matth. 24.31. which ſhewes that when the Sonne Iſrael's Redemption. Who doubtleſſe are not to be left, that the evill Angels may fetch them, for thIſrael's Redemption. For that by Chriſts judging the quicke and the dead, mentioned in 2 Tim. 4. canIſrael's Redemption.

      * The fift Synchroniſme of the ſecond part followes, whoſe arguments Mr. Petrie thus propoſeth and anſwereth.
Jſraels Redemption.THat Chriſt is already Mat. 1. v. 20.21. Luk 2.11. Ioh. 1.29.30. &c. come; that aIſrael's Redemption. 2. And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption. Againe, I know no reaſon, why we ſhould give more credit to the metaphoricall iIſrael's Redemption. And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption. Another Prophecie touching the renewed eſtate of the creatures, is to be ſeen iIſrael's Redemption. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediatelIſrael's Redemption. And this is as much as I need ſay, though not above halfe that the Prophets ſayIſrael's Redemption. And ſo I paſſe from the thing to be reſtor'd, which is the Kingdome of Iſrael: THat our Mediatour hath undergone the Offices of a Prieſt and Prophet, the Goſpel is our witneſſe: bIſrael's Redemption. And the reaſon of it, (as is intimated in the firſt words) is becauſe the time Iſrael's Redemption. The like encouragement he gave alſo to his Diſciples before his paſſion. Ye areIſrael's Redemption. I know theſe words are taken by Interpreters, for a metaphoricall expreſſion ofIſrael's Redemption. For beſides, that there is little analogy and reſemblance betwixt a perpetuall Iſrael's Redemption. And as it is evident from his owne words, that the Throne of his Kingdome is noIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre Saint Paul, whoſe words doe clearely prove, that the reigne of ChriſIſrael's Redemption. Of this Kingdome alſo ſpeakes Saint Peter, in Acts 3.19. Repent ye therefore, aIſrael's Redemption And here we may call to minde too, our Saviours words to Iames and Iohn, when thIſrael's Redemption. Which ſaying, as it doth ſhew that our Saviour had before acquainted the ApoſtlIſrael's Redemption. Which is a Prerogative peculiar to the Sonne alone, a preheminence, I ſay, whicIſrael's Redemption. And the ſame Apoſtles words, in 2 Tim. 4. may not be forgotten: I charge thee, Iſrael's Redemption. And to my ſeeming, that propheticall image in the 2 of Dan. ver. 13. which reprIſrael's Redemption. And as the falling of the ſtone upon the feece of the image, upon the laſt, andIſrael's Redemption. For if the Kingdome of God there ſpoken of, were to be underſtood of a KingdomeIſrael's Redemption. And that nought elſe is meant by the world to come, in Heb 2.5. but this KingdoIſrael's Redemption. And if there be yet a world which is to be put in ſubjection to Chriſt as man, Iſrael's Redemption. For that which is to be given up, is already paſt.Mr. Petrie's Anſwer.That whicIſrael's Redemption. And it is no where ſaid, that the new Jeruſalem, the City of eternall glory, ſh ANd thus it hath bin proved by conſequence, that our Saviour ſhall hereafter reigne on earth. You ſIſrael's Redemption. For neither did Chriſt at his firſt comming, ſit on Davids Throne, nor any otheIſrael's Redemption. Neither were Judah and Iſrael, then in the Land together.Mr. Petrie's Anſwer.ThIſrael's Redemption. Nei•her was the Temple then deſtroyed, but afterwards: and therefore the thingsIſrael's Redemption. You ſee here that our Saviour comes not onely to conquer death, (which is the lIſrael's Redemption. For that this may be fulfilled, it is requiſite, that he be on earth, whither tIſrael's Redemption. And although it be ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for e ANd thus even one prophecy of Zech. doth clearely unfold, all that we averre touching our preſent ſIſrael's Redemption.

And this will appeare to a diligent eye, even out of the controverſed place in Iſrael's R•demption. It is ſaid alſo, that they lived and reigned with Chriſt a 1000 yeares. But howIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, The reigne of Chriſt doth not beginne till Antichriſt is deſtroyed,Iſrael's Redemption. The aſſumption is grounded on Rev. 11.15. which ſhewes, that till the time of tIſrael's Redemption.

This then being ſo, I ſee not, but that Gods fore-appointment of a thouſand yeaIſrael's Redemption To this alſo may be added that i•Matth. 24.31. which ſhewes that when the Sonne Iſrael's Redemption.

And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption.

And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption.

And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption.

And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption.

And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption.

And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption.

And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption.

And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption.

The ſecond Argument.

The third argument.
Courteous Reader,THere was of late in this Kingdome one Mr. Mede, a grave and learned Divine of the Jſraels Redemption.THat Chriſt is already Mat. 1. v. 20.21. Luk 2.11. Ioh. 1.29.30. &c. come; that aIſrael's Redemption. 2. And yet (wltih ſubmiſſion to impartial judgements be it ſpoken) I finde not Iſrael's Redemption. For—they asked of him, ſaying, Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore againe the KIſrael's Redemption. The words you ſee are a Querie. And ſuch propoſitions imply three things, Firſt ANd firſt of the firſt; That the Kingdom of the Jewes ſhall again be reſtor'd unto them, For they aIſrael's Redemption. Firſt, becauſe the Authours of this demand were not babes, either in yeares or Iſrael's Redemption. A ſecond reaſon, which makes me diſi aſt the cenſure here caſt on our Apoſtles,Iſrael's Redemption. Another reaſon which makes for our Apoſtles, is the anſwer our Saviour gave theIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre wee have argued topically, & by way of probability. But that which ſIſrael's Redemption. And with what teſtimonies can we better begin, then with ſuch as are of neereſtIſrael's Redemption. And this the next verſe doth confirm, which tels us, that at the time of this rIſrael's Redemption. Another prophecy much like unto this, is that of Amos in his 9. chap. at the 8.Iſrael's Redemption. The next prophecy ſhall be that of Joel, who mentions the very ſignes, which ouIſrael's Redemption. I am not ignorant, that the darkening of the Sun and Moone, is ſometimes taken Iſrael's Redemption. Neither have I forgotten, that the firſt of theſe prophecies was made uſe of byIſrael's Redemption. And ſecondly, becauſe as the Prophet revealed, ſo he repeates the powring out oIſrael's Redemption. And to put it out of doubt, that God's bringing downe of the Heathen into the vIſrael's Redemption. Now how can wee forſake the literal interpretation of theſe prophecies, if we dIſrael's Redemption. And if this be not to cry, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. If this be notIſrael's Redemption. But enough of the perplexity which ſhall happen to other Nations when the JewesIſrael's Redemption. Such another Prophecie is that of Ezek. in his 37. chap. at the 19. ver. Thus ſIſrael's Redemption. For though this of Hoſea be underſtood by ſome Expoſitours of the vocation of tIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how can that belong to the Gentiles, which was prophecied onely ofIſrael's Redemption. And the place where they were told ſo was their owne land, and therfore in thatIſrael's Redemption. And therefore I ſhould rather take it to be brought in by St. Paul, as a teſtimIſrael's Redemption. And this the 14. verſe ſeemes to confirme, where it is ſaid, Iſaiah alſo criethIſrael's Redemption. There is yet in the 3. ch. of Hoſea, at the 4. v. one more materiall Argument fBUt we are yet to ſhew the Jews pious, peaceable and proſperous eſtate after their returne. Read theIſrael's Redemption. Which Prophecies, as they doe containe many evident and unanſwerable arguments Iſrael's Redemption. And yet there want not ſome, who by the words [All Iſrael] in the 11. of the Ro YOu have hitherto heard of the deliverance and happineſſe of the Jewes onely; I ſhall now acquaint Iſrael's Redemption. I know that moſt of theſe Prophecies are chiefly interpreted of the joyning togIſrael's Redemption. But to ſay, that this is now fulfilled, in the time of the ſubſtituted GentilesIſrael's Redemption. And as for thoſe which were converted at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, andIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, how the bringing of the Jewes out of all Nations upon horſes, and Iſrael's Redemption. Againe, I know no reaſon, why we ſhould give more credit to the metaphoricall iIſrael's Redemption. And what compariſon is there, betwixt the griefe of a few fearfull and ſcattere ANd thus much of the felicity of that remnant of the Nations which ſhall outlive the reſt at the JeIſrael's Redemption. And beſides, is there no hurt nor deſtruction in all the Chriſtian world, that Iſrael's Redemption. As then there can be no ſufficient reaſon alledg'd for the allegoricall interprIſrael's Redemption. Another Prophecie touching the renewed eſtate of the creatures, is to be ſeen iIſrael's Redemption. And it is the more likely to be ſo here (not onely becauſe the words immediatelIſrael's Redemption. And this is as much as I need ſay, though not above halfe that the Prophets ſayIſrael's Redemption. And ſo I paſſe from the thing to be reſtor'd, which is the Kingdome of Iſrael: THat our Mediatour hath undergone the Offices of a Prieſt and Prophet, the Goſpel is our witneſſe: bIſrael's Redemption. And the reaſon of it, (as is intimated in the firſt words) is becauſe the time Iſrael's Redemption. The like encouragement he gave alſo to his Diſciples before his paſſion. Ye areIſrael's Redemption. I know theſe words are taken by Interpreters, for a metaphoricall expreſſion ofIſrael's Redemption. For beſides, that there is little analogy and reſemblance betwixt a perpetuall Iſrael's Redemption. And as it is evident from his owne words, that the Throne of his Kingdome is noIſrael's Redemption. Thus farre Saint Paul, whoſe words doe clearely prove, that the reigne of ChriſIſrael's Redemption. Of this Kingdome alſo ſpeakes Saint Peter, in Acts 3.19. Repent ye therefore, aIſrael's Redemption And here we may call to minde too, our Saviours words to Iames and Iohn, when thIſrael's Redemption. Which ſaying, as it doth ſhew that our Saviour had before acquainted the ApoſtlIſrael's Redemption. Which is a Prerogative peculiar to the Sonne alone, a preheminence, I ſay, whicIſrael's Redemption. And the ſame Apoſtles words, in 2 Tim. 4. may not be forgotten: I charge thee, Iſrael's Redemption. And to my ſeeming, that propheticall image in the 2 of Dan. ver. 13. which reprIſrael's Redemption. And as the falling of the ſtone upon the feece of the image, upon the laſt, andIſrael's Redemption. For if the Kingdome of God there ſpoken of, were to be underſtood of a KingdomeIſrael's Redemption. And that nought elſe is meant by the world to come, in Heb 2.5. but this KingdoIſrael's Redemption. And if there be yet a world which is to be put in ſubjection to Chriſt as man, Iſrael's Redemption.

Which words as they doe eſtabliſh the literall ſenſe of the Luke 14.14. ch. 20.Iſrael's Redemption. And as the Elders in Revel. 5.10. ſaid in the hearing of Saint John, Thou beſt Iſrael's Redemption. And this will appeare to a diligent eye, even out of the controverſed place in Iſrael's R•demption. It is ſaid alſo, that they lived and reigned with Chriſt a 1000 yeares. But howIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, The reigne of Chriſt doth not beginne till Antichriſt is deſtroyed,Iſrael's Redemption. The aſſumption is grounded on Rev. 11.15. which ſhewes, that till the time of tIſrael's Redemption. And this alſo is intimated, by the binding up of Rev. 20.1, 2, 3. &c. Satan a tIſrael's Redemption. Which viſion, as it is the next to that of the battell, wherein the Beaſt and f NOw againſt this which hath been ſaid touching our Saviours Kingdome, his owne words i• the 18 of SIſrael's Redemption. And to all ſuch places that mention only the diſſolution of the elements, and tIſrael's Redemption. And in my conceit, Saint Peter in the very next verſe doth intimate as much; foIſrael's Redemption. This then being ſo, I ſee not, but that Gods fore-appointment of a thouſand yeaIſrael's Redemption To this alſo may be added that i•Matth. 24.31. which ſhewes that when the Sonne Iſrael's Redemption. Who doubtleſſe are not to be left, that the evill Angels may fetch them, for thIſrael's Redemption. For that by Chriſts judging the quicke and the dead, mentioned in 2 Tim. 4. canIſrael's Redemption. And to this conjecture, Iſai. 27.12. doth ſufficiently confirme; For the great Iſrael's Redemption. And thus being thr•ughly ſatisfied by this cloud of witneſſes, the double Jury Iſrael's Redemption. Firſt, to praiſe God for his abundant mercy, who through the fall of the Iewes,Iſrael's Redemption. Secondly, to beware of unbeliefe: which was the cauſe that the Jewes were brokeIſrael's Redemption. Thirdly, not to contemne or revile the Jewes, a fault too common in the ChriſtiIſrael's Redemption. And laſtly, earneſtly to beſeech God, that he would ſpeedily put into execution
